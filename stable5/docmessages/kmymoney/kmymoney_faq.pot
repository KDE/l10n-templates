"There are many reasons &kmymoney; might crash or give an error instead of "
"starting up normally. Sometimes an error message is shown, but if not, you "
"can run &kmymoney; from a command line, to see if any useful information is "
"output to the console. On &Linux;, this just means typing \"kmymoney\" in a "
"shell. &macOS; should be similar. On &Windows;, you will need to type the "
"full path to the &kmymoney; executable."

"You cannot make any changes to a transaction with a date before the opening "

"A transaction is shown in red if any part of the amount has not been "
