"A loan is an agreement under which a borrower receives money from a lender "
"and agrees to return the money as one or more repayments in the future. "
"&kmymoney; allows you to track loans by which you, as borrower, receive "
"money from or, as lender, give money to someone else. Most individuals "
"borrow more than they lend, so you will generally be the borrower and a "
"finance company will generally be the lender. If you lend money to a family "
"member or a friend, you can use &kmymoney; to keep track of this loan as "
