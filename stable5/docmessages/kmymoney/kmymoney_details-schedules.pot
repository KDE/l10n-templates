"Sometimes called a scheduled transaction or a recurring transaction, a "
"schedule provides a means to record information about a transaction that "
"happens on a regular basis. You can schedule deposit, transfer, withdrawal, "

"A schedule consists of two main parts: the transaction data and the "

"&ie;, when the transaction is to be entered into the ledger and how. The "

"options for Payment method, Account, Pay to/from, Category, Tags, Memo, Due "
