"KXStitch is a program that lets you create cross stitch patterns and charts. "
"Patterns can be created from scratch on a user defined size of grid, which "
"can be enlarged or reduced in size as your pattern progresses. Alternatively "
"you can import images from many graphics formats which will allow you to "
"reduce the number of colors and to restrict the conversion to full stitches "
"or optionally use fractional stitches. You may also use an image as a "
"background. These imported images can then be modified using the supplied "
"tools to produce your final design."

"There are many tools to aid designing your pattern, from open and filled "
"rectangles and ellipses, filled polygons and lines and backstitching. "
"Additionally cut, copy and paste can be used to duplicate selected areas. "
"Selected areas can also be rotated 90, 180 and 270 degrees anti clockwise, "
"or mirrored horizontally or vertically."

"There is also a pattern library that can be used to store small and not so "
"small portions of patterns that can then be reused in other patterns. The "
"patterns in these libraries are stored in a hierarchical list that makes it "
"easy to sort and navigate them to find the ones you want. These pattern "
"libraries can also be used as alphabets by assigning a character to each "
"one. By using the Alphabet tool, each key press is searched for in the "
"current library and if present, the associated pattern will be inserted in "
"the pattern."
