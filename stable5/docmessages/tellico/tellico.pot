"&tellico; is a program for managing collections. It began as a simple book "
"collection manager, and has expanded to include default collection templates "
"for bibliographies, comic books, videos, music, coins, stamps, trading "
"cards, video games, wines, board games, and file listings. In addition, "
"custom collections can be built for any other type of collectibles."

"&tellico; is not an audio or video player. It does not provide facilities "

"image-editing functionality. Although &tellico; has some functionality for "
"managing bibliography lists, it is not a full-blown bibliographic reference "
"manager. &tellico; also does not pretend to have all the capabilities of a "
"full-fledged relational database."

"An entry is the basic record in &tellico;. Each entry contains a single "
"value for each field in the collection. A collection may have an unlimited "
"number of entries, in theory, although since the whole collection is always "

"&tellico; has been tested with a collection of 10,000 entries, and the speed "
"was satisfactory. However, if many large images are included in the "
"collection, the loading and processing time does slow down greatly. "
"Performance can be improved by having &tellico; store images separate from "
"the data file itself, either in the application-specific folder or a folder "
"relative to the data file. More information can be found in the <link "
"linkend=\"configuration\">configuration section</link>."
