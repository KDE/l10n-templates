"The desktop toolbox, accessed via the upper left corner has a button for "
"displaying your activities, of which &plasma; allows you to have more than "
"one. Basically, that is multiple desktop containments hosting multiple sets "
"of &plasma; widgets. Display the <quote>Activities</quote> bar, select one "
"of the predefined activities or choose <guilabel>Create Activity</guilabel> "
"to create a new containment, select your new containment and customize "
"suiting your taste. &plasma;’s activities and &kwin;’s desktop grid are "
"similar in that respect, but there is a fundamental difference. While "
"virtual desktop are used to group and organize windows, &plasma;’s "
"activities are used to group and organize &plasma; widgets. This way, you "
"can switch between activities and have relevant &plasma; widgets supporting "
"the task you are currently trying to accomplish. You can create a "
"<quote>Free time</quote> activity, with comic strips, a puzzle and other "
"&plasma; widgets, and a <quote>Work</quote> activity, with relevant "
