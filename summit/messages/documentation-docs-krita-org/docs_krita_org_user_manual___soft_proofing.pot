msgid "When we make an image in Krita, and print that out with a printer, the image tends to look different. The colors are darker, or less dark than expected, maybe the reds are more aggressive, maybe contrast is lost. For simple documents, this isn’t much of a problem, but for professional prints, this can be very sad, as it can change the look and feel of an image drastically."
msgstr ""

#. +> trunk5
#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:23
msgid "The reason this happens is simply because the printer uses a different color model (CMYK) and it has often access to a lower range of colors (called a gamut)."

msgid "A naive person would suggest the following solution: do your work within the CMYK color model! But there are three problems with that:"
msgstr ""

#. +> trunk5
#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:27
msgid "Painting in a CMYK space doesn’t guarantee that the colors will be the same on your printer. For each combination of Ink, Paper and Printing device, the resulting gamut of colors you can use is different, which means that each of these could have a different profile associated with them."
msgstr ""

#. +> trunk5
#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:28
msgid "Furthermore, even if you have the profile and are working in the exact color space that your printer can output, the CMYK color space is very irregular, meaning that the color maths isn’t as nice as in other spaces. Blending modes are different in CMYK as well."
msgstr ""

#. +> trunk5
#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:29
msgid "Finally, working in that specific CMYK space means that the image is stuck to that space. If you are preparing your work for different a CMYK profile, due to the paper, printer or ink being different, you might have a bigger gamut with more bright colors that you would like to take advantage of."

#. +> trunk5
#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:31
msgid "So ideally, you would do the image in RGB, and use all your favorite RGB tools, and let the computer do a conversion to a given CMYK space on the fly, just for preview. This is possible, and is what we call ''Soft Proofing''."

msgid "You can toggle soft proofing on any image using the :kbd:`Ctrl + Y` shortcut. Unlike other programs, this is per-view, so that you can look at your image non-proofed and proofed, side by side. The proofing configuration can also be set per image, and saved into the ``.kra`` file. Just enable :guilabel:`Store Softproofing configuration in the image` in the proofing options in :menuselection:`Image --> Image Properties --> Soft Proofing`. If the checkbox is unchecked, then Krita will use global settings from :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure Krita... --> Color Management --> Soft Proofing` (for more details see :ref:`here <color_management_settings_softproofing>`)."

Please take it into account that the viewing conditions' white point will still be adjusted to the one of the screen.
