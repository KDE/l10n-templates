msgid "Font Families don't correspond to single font files. Instead, they can represent a collection of fonts of varying types. Krita will spend some time trying to organize all the fonts on your system into a proper hierarchy, so you can select fonts as desired while using the text properties like font-weight and font-style to indicate the weight and width you need."

Furthermore, it will also show an icon to indicate whether the font is a variable font, or, for color fonts, to indicate which color technologies are available."

msgid ":term:`OpenType` variable fonts are special in that unlike normal font families, simple variations like width and weights are all included into a single font. Variable fonts are able to smoothly interpolate between the different variations, with width and weight becoming an :dfn:`axis` of variation. It is not limited to these either, other examples include :guilabel:`Slant` or :guilabel:`Optical Size`. Krita has full support for these fonts, and their axes can be modified in the :ref:`text_property_font_style` section of the Text Properties Docker."
