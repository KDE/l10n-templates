msgid "You may have seen artists show little progress movies of their work. This is called a time lapse! Normally a time lapse is recorded using outside software, like OBS, and then sped up around 16 times, and they are used to convey the whole amount of effort that went into an image. The recorder docker simplifies making a time lapse, by taking a snapshot every stroke and then letting you :ref:`render it to a video file with ffmpeg <render_animation>`. Because this docker relies on FFMpeg, it cannot be used on Android."

msgid "The recorder docker makes a snapshot of the canvas every few seconds, or at the end of every stroke. You can tell it's turned on because there will be a :guilabel:`recording` symbol in the status bar, which is red when it's making snapshots and white when it's on standby."

#. +> trunk5
#: ../../reference_manual/dockers/recorder_docker.rst:22
msgid "Because it stores the snapshots, that means you can take breaks, close the image, turn off the computer, come back a month later. However, snapshots can take up quite a bit of space, so if you are running out of space, don't forget to check the temporary folder!"

msgid "Some people also call time lapses 'speed paints', but these are not the same thing. A speed paint is when you try to draw an image in a far shorter time than is usual for you. For example, drawing a whole landscape in 15 to 30 minutes. People like to record their speed paints, and because both speed paints and time lapses are videos, people often confuse them."
