This makes it easier to set the angle in different ways with just the mouse or pen. This default behavior can be altered by using keyboard modifiers: if the :kbd:`Ctrl` key is pressed while dragging, then the angle will always be snapped to multiples of fifteen degrees, no matter the distance from the cursor to the gauge; if the :kbd:`Shift` key is pressed while dragging, then the angle will never be snapped, no matter the distance from the cursor to the gauge; if both the :kbd:`Ctrl` and :kbd:`Shift` keys are pressed while dragging, the angle will be snapped to integer values (useful only when the angle selector allows decimal values)."

But, when there is no enough space in the user interface, those may be put together in the form of a menu under a single dropdown button, or even be hidden completely, leaving only the circular gauge and the maths input visible.
