msgid "Sometimes especially in the field of game development, artists need to work with the alpha channel of the texture separately. To assist such workflow, Krita has a special functionality called :menuselection:`Split Alpha`. It allows splitting alpha channel of a paint layer into a separate :ref:`transparency_masks`. The artist can work on the transparency mask in an isolated environment and merge it back when he has finished working."

It happens because when compositing the layers of the image, Krita drop color data of fully transparent pixels for efficiency reason. To avoid this of color data loss you can either avoid compositing of the image i.e. limit image to only one layer without any masks or effects, or use the following method:"

msgid "Krita treats all color channel values in fully transparent pixels as **undefined**. Effectively, it means that Krita will try to skip writing to (or reading from) a fully transparent pixel, unless it is really needed or explicitly requested. That is done for optimization purposes and allows Krita to speed up compositing the image by a lot."
