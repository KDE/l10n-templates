msgid "An epoch is a certain instant of time (usually past) used as a reference for time measurement in astronomy. In order to make calculations easier, astronomers usually use the number of days that have passed since a certain moment in time as a way of representing time in astronomical calculations. This arbitrarily chosen \"starting point\" reference for time is called an epoch."

msgid "An epoch is usually cited along with :ref:`equatorial coordinates <ai-skycoords-equatorial>` in astronomical catalogs, since the equatorial coordinates of sky objects change (although slowly) with time. Printed star charts / atlases are usually marked as being valid for a certain epoch."
