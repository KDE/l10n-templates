Addons catalogs are available via the ``Data`` → ``Download New Data...`` menu item where you can download catalogs provided by KStars team and the community through the `catalog packaging repository <https://invent.kde.org/vboettcher/kstars-catalogs>`__. The ``DSO minimal zoom:`` slider controls the minimal zoom level for which the DSOs are shown. Increasing the minimal zoom level can lead to performance improvements when panning the skymap zoomed-out. The ``DSO cache percentage:`` slider regulates how much of the DSO master catalog is being kept in memory. If you experience memory issues with large catalogs, try lowering the percentage. The ``Label density:`` slider controls the perceived density of labels for the DSOs. If labels start to overlap and the skymap begins to look too crowded, try tuning this option. The ``Faint limit zoomed in/out:`` regulates up to which magnitude objects are shown on the skymap (higher magnitude is fainter).

The aim of this tool-chain is to reproducibly build catalogs in a homogeneous environment. Every catalog is implemented `as a python module <https://invent.kde.org/vboettcher/kstars-catalogs/-/blob/master/catalogs/sharpless_2.py>`__ and provides standard methods to acquire data, parse it and find duplicates in other catalogs. All downloadable catalogs are implemented this way. If you'd like to make a catalog of your own available for KStars, it is recommended that you implement it as a package in the repository. The tooling provided there is so flexible, that it should work for you. For more information on how to do that see the `catalog repository documentation <https://protagon.space/catalogs/>`__. If you are not familiar with python programming you can request the addition of a catalog by opening a ticket in the repository or contacting `the maintainers <https://invent.kde.org/vboettcher/kstars-catalogs/-/project_members>`__. KStars provides also provides means to create custom catalogs by manually entering data or importing CSV tables, but those are less flexible and offer no deduplication."

msgid "In the top right you can choose whether coordinates are being expressed in degrees or hours/minutes/seconds. The ``Mapping`` section lets you map columns in the CSV file to data fields in KStars. Selecting ``Ignore`` assigns the default value for this field. Entering your own text will use this as the value for every object being read. The ``Type Mapping`` section maps strings to object types. You can add and remove mappings by clicking + or -. When you're done mapping, you can test your settings by clicking ``Preview`` to read the first few objects from the csv. If you are satisfied you can click ``OK`` to import the whole catalog or adjust your settings and preview again. As a reference, a mapping for the OpenNGC catalog is shown in the below screenshot."
