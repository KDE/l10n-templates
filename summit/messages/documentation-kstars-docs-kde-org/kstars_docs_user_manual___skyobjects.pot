msgid "KStars displays thousands of celestial objects: stars, planets, comets, asteroids, clusters, nebulae and galaxies. You can interact with displayed objects to perform actions on them or obtain more information about them. Clicking on an object will identify it in the status bar, and simply hovering the mouse cursor on an object will label it temporarily in the map. Double-clicking will recenter the display on the object and begin tracking it (so that it will remain centered as time passes). Right clicking an object opens the object's popup menu, which provides more options."

Many of the objects only have a numeric catalog name (for example, NGC 3077), but some objects have a common name as well (for example, Whirlpool Galaxy). You can filter the list by name and by object type. To filter by name, enter a string in the edit box at the top of the window; the list will then only contain names which start with that string. To filter by type, select a type from the combo box at the bottom of the window."

msgid "KStars provides another method for resolving the objects that are missing from any of its predefined catalogues, by using an internet connection. Thus, if you want to find an object that KStars is not aware of, you can easily do this by querying several professional astronomical databases as: SIMBAD, NED or VizieR. This can be done by entering the object's name and then press the ``or search the internet`` for `ObjectName` button. After your object is found, you can use it exactly as any object that is already loaded into KStars (i.e. adding it to the Observing WishList). If the object was not found in the online databases, then a warning dialogue will pop-up. Once you resolve an object by using this method, it is stored in KStars database, so if you close KStars and open it again, your object will still be there."

msgid "You can choose to enable or disable this feature by checking or unchecking the ``Resolve names not known to KStars`` using online services check box from ``Catalogs`` page, inside of ``Configure - KStars`` dialog (select the ``Settings`` → ``Configure KStars...`` menu item). If this checkbox is checked, when an object name unknown to KStars is entered in the ``Find Dialog``, KStars will contact online services to learn about the desired object and then add it directly to KStars database. The objects acquired in this manner are stored in a fake catalog, called “\\_Internet_Resolved”. Thus, you can enable or disable the display of these objects by checking or unchecking the “\\_Internet_Resolved” catalog from the catalogues list. Note that you can not delete this fake catalogue, as you can do with a custom catalogue. If this checkbox is unchecked, then the ``Find Object`` window will be exactly the same, excepting a minor change: the online searching button will no longer be visible."
