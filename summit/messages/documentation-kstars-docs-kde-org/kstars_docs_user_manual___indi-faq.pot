msgid "INDI is the `Instrument-Neutral-Distributed-Interface <https://indilib.org>`__ control protocol developed by **Elwood C. Downey** of `ClearSky Institute <https://www.clearskyinstitute.com/>`__. KStars employs device drivers that are compatible with the INDI protocol. INDI has many advantages including loose coupling between hardware devices and software drivers. Clients that use the device drivers (like KStars) are completely unaware of the device capabilities. In run time, KStars communicates with the device drivers and builds a completely dynamical GUI based on services provided by the device. Therefore, new device drivers can be written or updated and KStars can take full advantage of them without any changes on the client side."

msgid "What operations does KStars provide to control the telescope?"
msgstr ""

#. +> trunk5
#: ../../user_manual/indi-faq.rst:26
msgid "It depends on the particular telescope you're running, but the minimum three operations are :command:`Slew`, :command:`Track`, and :command:`Sync`, which you can issue directly from the sky map. Your telescope must be aligned for those operations to perform correctly. Some telescopes offer you more operations like site management, slew modes, focusing, parking, and more. You can access the telescopes extended features from the ``Tools`` → ``Devices`` → ``INDI Control Panel...`` menu item."

msgid "What's the difference between :command:`Slew`, :command:`Track`, and :command:`Sync` exactly?"
msgstr ""

#. +> trunk5
#: ../../user_manual/indi-faq.rst:33
msgid "The command :command:`Slew` orders the telescope to move to a particular target, and once the telescope reaches its target, the telescope keeps tracking that target at a *sidereal* rate (i.e., the rate at which stars move across the sky). This works well for stars, Messier objects, and about everything outside our solar system. But solar system objects travel differently across the sky and so the telescope must :command:`Track` the objects as they move."
msgstr ""

#. +> trunk5
#: ../../user_manual/indi-faq.rst:35
msgid "Therefore, you need to issue a track command if you want to track an object with non-sidereal motion. On the other hand, :command:`Sync` is used to synchronize the telescope's internal coordinates with that of an object you select."

msgid "Can I control my telescope remotely?"
msgstr ""

#. +> trunk5
#: ../../user_manual/indi-faq.rst:44
msgid "Yes. You can start an INDI server on the machine connected to your telescope and the server will listen to requests from KStars clients. Once you're connected, you can control your telescope directly from the sky map. This procedure is described in detail in the :doc:`Remote device control <indi-remote-control>` section."
