msgid "The window is divided into a number of tabs. In the ``General`` tab, we present basic data about the current object. This includes names and catalog designations, object type, and :doc:`magnitude <ai-magnitude>` (brightness). On the ``Position`` tab are the object's Equatorial and Horizontal coordinates, as well as its rise, set and transit times."

msgid "In the ``Links`` tab, you can manage the internet links associated with this object. The Image and Information links associated with the object are listed. These are the links that appear in the popup menu when the object is right-clicked. You can add custom links to the object with the ``Add Link...`` button. This will open a window in which you fill in the URL and link text for the new link (you can also test the URL in the web browser from this window). Every time you add a custom URL to a certain object, you are able to choose the resource type using the ``Resource Type`` button. Keep in mind that the custom link can easily point to a file on your local disk, so you can use this feature to index your personal astronomical images or observing logs."

The database is divided into four general subject areas (Astronomy and Astrophysics, Astrophysics Preprints, Instrumentation, and Physics and Geophysics). Each of these has three sub-nodes that query the database in different ways. “Keyword search” will return articles which listed the object's name as a keyword. “Title word search” will return articles which included the object name in their Title, and the “Title & Keyword search” uses both options together."
