msgid "In order to focus an image, Ekos needs to establish a numerical method for gauging how *good* your focus is. It's easy when you look at an image and can see it as *unfocused*, as the human eye is very good at detecting that, but *how* can Ekos possibly know that?"

msgid "The most tried and tested method is Half-Flux-Radius (HFR), which is a measure of the width in pixels counting from the center of the star until the accumulated intensity is half of the total flux of the star. As you move closer to the point of optimum focus, so the HFR gets smaller, reaching a minimum at the point of focus before increasing as you start to move away from focus. HFR has been used on lots of different types of equipment and has proved to be stable in a wide range of circumstances."

It then fits a quadratic curve to the datapoints and calculates the point of optimum focus. It then moves out again past the point of optimum focus, halves the stepsize and moves in again for a second pass. It looks to follow the curve from the first pass and find the minimum HFR. Due to randomness in the HFR measurements it uses the % tolerance to help decide when it has found a solution. Key features include:"

msgid "**Iterative**: In the Iterative algorithm, Ekos operates iteratively by moving in discrete steps, decided initially by the user-configurable step size and later by the slope of the V-Curve, to get closer to the optimal focus position where it then changes gears and performs smaller, finer moves to reach the optimal focus. The focus process stops when the measured HFR is within the configurable tolerance of the minimum recorded HFR in the process. In other words, whenever the process starts searching for a solution within a narrowly limited range, it checks if the current HFR is within % difference compared to the minimum HFR recorded, and if this condition is met then the Autofocus process is considered successful.  The default value is set to 1% and is sufficient for most situations. The Step options specify the number of initial ticks the focuser has to move. If the image is severely out of focus, we set the step size high (i.e. greater than 250). On the other hand, if the focus is close to optimal focus, we set the step size to a more reasonable range (less than 50). It takes trial and error to find the best starting tick, but Ekos only uses that for the first focus motion, as all subsequent motions depend on the V-Curve slope calculations. Key features include:"
