msgid "``Connection Mode``: Ekos can be started either locally or remotely. Local mode is when Ekos is running in the same machine as INDI server, i.e. all the devices are connected directly to the machine. If you run INDI server on a remote machine (for example, on a Raspberry PI), you need to set the INDI server host and port."

msgid "``Auto Connect``: Check this option to enable automatic connection to all your devices after INDI server is started. If unchecked, INDI devices are created but not automatically connected. This is useful when you want to make changes to the driver (e.g. change baud rate or IP address or any other settings) *before* you connect to it."

Port Selector is used to select initial serial and network communication parameters for the devices in the equipment profile. After connecting to equipment for the first time, the Port Selector popup is displayed where the communication parameters can be set before establishing connection. Once connected, the Port Selector option is turned off. It can be toggled to checked in the profile editor to enable it back."

Please note that if you have a CCD with a guide head, you can leave the guider drop-down menu *blank* as Ekos will auto-detect the guide head from the CCD camera. Similarly, if your CCD includes embedded filter wheel support, then you do *not* need to specify the filter wheel device in the filter drop-down menu."

msgid "``Scripts``: Adjust pre-driver and post-driver delays and scripts for each driver. A rule can be defined for each driver in case there is a need to introduce delays before and/or after starting a particular driver. The fields before the driver selection dropdown are to be executed *before* the driver is started, whereas the fields after the driver selection dropdown are to be executed *after* the driver started. The script field, if specified, should include the full path to an executable script with the appropriate permissions.  All drivers configured in the scripts editor would be started first and in order before the rest of the equipment profile drivers."
