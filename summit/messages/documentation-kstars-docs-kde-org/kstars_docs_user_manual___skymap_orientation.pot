msgid "First, pick the coordinate system that matches your mount. For an equatorially mounted instrument, switch to the Equatorial Coordinate mode in the ``View`` menu or by pressing the **Space** key. The option to toggle the coordinate system should read ``Switch to Horizontal View (Horizontal Coordinates)`` when the current mode is Equatorial Coordinates. For an altazimuth-mounted instrument or naked-eye viewing, switch to Horizontal Coordinates, so that the option in the ``View`` menu reads ``Switch to Star Globe View (Equatorial Coordinates)``. This sets the base coordinate system used to render the sky map, and also sets the reference for the orientation of the skymap: zenith or north."

msgid "Next, to rotate the sky map freely, you can hold down the **Shift** key and drag the mouse on the sky map. A temporary overlay will appear showing the direction of north and zenith at the point, and displaying the angle they make with the vertical in a counterclockwise sense. The orientations of zenith and north will update as you rotate the sky map. Letting go of **Shift** or the mouse button will stop the rotation operation. As you pan the sky map or focus it on different objects, the rotation you set is retained as an offset from the reference direction. The reference direction is north when using Equatorial Coordinates and zenith when using Horizontal Coordinates. As a reminder, the reference direction is solid and brighter in the temporary overlay. The temporary overlay also marks the East direction, which will be clockwise from north when mirrored and counter-clockwise when not mirrored. For the two common orientations of erect and inverted, the rotation can be set / reset using the ``View`` → ``Skymap Orientation`` submenu. Select ``North Down`` or ``Zenith Down`` as is applicable to set an orientation of 180 degrees."

msgid "If you are visually observing through an eyepiece of an instrument, you may need to do some more correction. For the common case of a large Dobsonian telescope (or more generally a Newtonian design mounted on an altazimuth mount), an additional systematic correction is of help. This correction applies because we stand erect while using the telescope irrespective of the angle the telescope tube is making with the ground. So as we move the telescope in altitude, an additional correction depending on the altitude of the object needs to be applied to make the sky map match the view through the eyepiece where the observer is standing erect. This correction is enabled by choosing the appropriate \"Erect observer correction\" option in the ``View`` → ``Skymap Orientation`` submenu. The correction depends on which side the telescope's focuser is placed by the manufacturer. If when observing just above the horizon through the eyepiece, the sky is on the observer's right side (and the mirror to the left), pick the ``Erect observer correction``, right-handed option. Similarly, if the sky is to the left of the observer, choose the ``Erect observer correct``, ``left-handed`` option. This correction only makes sense in Horizontal Coordinate mode and is disabled when using equatorial coordinates."

msgid "It is typical in visual astronomy to use at least three different instruments: the unaided eye, a finder scope, and the main telescope. The orientations of these three will have different settings and will need frequent modification of all the aforementioned options. To make it easy to adjust these settings together, KStars provides the ``Views`` feature. This feature is accessible through the ``View`` → ``Views`` menu and the options contained therein. The ``Arbitrary`` view is not a real view, but the option that gets selected when the sky-map orientation is modified manually through the previously described options. The rest of the views are bona fide views. New views may be added, or the existing views may be edited, removed, or re-ordered using the ``View`` → ``Views`` → ``Edit Views...`` option. Choosing this brings up a window to manage the views:"

msgid "The ``Name`` field carries a unique name for the View. The ``Mount Type`` determines whether the reference direction used for orientation will be north or zenith. Typically, one would set this to the type of mount used for the telescope. However, when using refractors and Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescopes (SCTs) with a rotatable diagonal, the observer will have a tendency to re-orient the eyepiece for comfort so that the eyepiece remains at a fixed angle with respect to the zenith. For this reason, it makes sense to choose ``Altazimuth`` mounting even when the telescope is actually on an equatorial mount. Choose ``Equatorial`` mounting when the focuser will not be re-oriented, such as when using a camera on an equatorially mounted telescope. For Newtonian telescopes that invert (i.e. rotate by 180 degrees but do not change the handedness) of the view, pick the ``Inverted`` option. This is also the correct option for straight-through refractors and finder scopes. When using a erecting prism diagonal, the prism erects the inverted image by flipping it up-down. This results overall in a left-right mirrored image. Thus for telescopes that use an erecting prism, pick ``Mirrored``. A special kind of prism called an Amici roof prism not only erects the image vertically, but it also prevents left-right mirroring of the image. Finder scopes incorporating such a diagonal are normally called \"Right-Angle Correct Image\" or RACI finder scopes. Such diagonals may also be used on refractors and SCTs. When using such a prism that produces a correct image, choose the ``Correct`` option. The ``Mirrored on the vertical axis`` option is not encountered in typical astronomical instruments, but is provided for completeness. Two more factors need to be considered: one is the angle of the eyepiece with respect to the reference direction (north / zenith), and the other is the orientation of the observer's head (and notion of the vertical) which we explained when describing the erect observer correction feature. These two aspects are configured using the single slider titled ``Eyepiece Angle``. Two illustrations below the slider show the interpretation of this setting; on the left, as seen from the front as is more convenient for Newtonian telescopes, and on the right as is seen from the back, more convenient for refractors and Cassegrains. The observer naturally stands on the side that makes it more convenient to look through the eyepiece, so the erect observer correction is automatically adjusted accordingly. For eyepiece angles that are less than -1 degree on the slider, the ``Erect observer correction, right-handed`` option is applied. Similarly, for eyepiece angles that are greater than +1 degree, the ``Erect observer correction, left-handed`` is applied. At 0 degrees, no erect observer correction is applied. This correction is indicated by a silhouette of a person standing on the appropriate side of the telescope. In our convention, most mass-manufactured Dobsonians seem to have a correction around +45 degrees. Incidentally, this correction is also useful for finder scopes with diagonals. One may want to explicitly disable the erect observer correction even when the eyepiece angle is not zero. This is useful in case the view comes from a CCD camera that does not change angle with respect to the telescope body (unlike an observer's head), or if the display showing KStars' sky map is mounted on the telescope body itself. In this case the ``Display mounted on the telescope`` option can be checked. For the opposite effect, i.e. where the eyepiece angle is zero, but the observer is leaning to look through the eyepiece from one of the two sides, set the eyepiece angle to plus or minus 2 degrees to enable the erect observer correction; the minor difference will not be noticeable. Finally, one may want triggering of the view to also set the field-of-view of the sky map to some value, for example to set the FOV of a finder scope. In this case, the ``Also set the field of view`` check-box may be checked, and an approximate field-of-view to adjust may be specified. If this is not enabled, the zoom level of the sky map is not altered when this view is applied."
