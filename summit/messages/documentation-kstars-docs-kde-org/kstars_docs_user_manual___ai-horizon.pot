msgid "The *Horizon* is the line that separates Earth from Sky. More precisely, it is the line that divides all of the directions you can possibly look into two categories: those which intersect the Earth, and those which do not. At many locations, the Horizon is obscured by trees, buildings, mountains, etc. However, if you are on a ship at sea, the Horizon is strikingly apparent."
