msgid "The ``Single preview tab`` item is to display all captured FITS images in a single tab instead of multiple tabs per image. The ``Single window capture`` item is to display captured FITS images from all cameras in a single FITS Viewer window instead of a dedicated window to each camera. The ``Single window open`` item is to display opened FITS images in a single FITS Viewer window instead of a dedicated window to each file and the ``Independent window`` item is to make FITS Viewer window independent from KStars."

msgid "The right panel lists processing options. The ``Auto stretch`` item is to always apply auto stretch to images in FITS Viewer, ``Limited resources mode`` is to enable limited resource mode to turn off any resource-intensive operations, namely: ``Auto debayer`` (bayered images will not be debayered; only grayscale images are shown), ``Auto WCS`` (World Coordinate System data will not be processed; WCS maps sky coordinates to image coordinates; equatorial grid lines, object identification, and telescope slew within an image are disabled), and ``3D cube`` (RGB images will not be processed; only grayscale images are shown). You can switch off some of these resource-greedy operations separately as well."
