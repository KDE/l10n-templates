msgid "Consider a sphere, such as the Earth, or the :doc:`Celestial Sphere  <ai-csphere>`. The intersection of any plane with the sphere will result in a circle on the surface of the sphere. If the plane happens to contain the center of the sphere, the intersection circle is a *Great Circle*. Great circles are the largest circles that can be drawn on a sphere. Also, the shortest path between any two points on a sphere is always along a great circle."
