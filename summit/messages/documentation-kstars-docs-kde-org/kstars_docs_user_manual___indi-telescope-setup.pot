msgid "Most telescopes are equipped with RS232 interface for remote control. Connect the RS232 jack in your telescope to your computer's Serial/USB port. Traditionally, the RS232 connects to the serial port of your computer, but since many new laptops abandoned the serial port in favor of USB/FireWire ports, you might need to obtain a Serial to USB adaptor to use with new laptops."
