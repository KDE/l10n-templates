msgid "Now that we have the time and location set, let us have a look around. You can pan the display using the arrow keys. If you hold down the **Shift** key before panning, the scrolling speed is increased. The display can also be panned by clicking and dragging with the mouse. Note that while the display is scrolling, not all objects are displayed. This is done to cut down on the CPU load of recomputing object positions, which makes the scrolling smoother (you can configure what gets hidden while scrolling in the :doc:`Configure - KStars  <config>` window). There are several ways to change the magnification (or *Zoom level*) of the display:"

If you have not adjusted the default KStars configuration, the display will be solid green below the horizon, representing the solid ground of the Earth. There is also a white curve, which represents the :doc:`celestial equator  <ai-cequator>`, and a brown curve, which represents the :doc:`Ecliptic  <ai-ecliptic>`, the path that the Sun appears to follow across the sky over the course of a year. The Sun is always found somewhere along the Ecliptic, and the planets are never far from it."

You can also configure which colors KStars uses for drawing these curves, using the ``Colors`` page."
