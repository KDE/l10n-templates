msgid "You can run devices by browsing the device tree, selecting a specific device, and then clicking on the ``Run Service`` button. You can select the operation mode, either local or server as defined above. The port number is randomly generated between the range from 7624 to 10,000. To specify a port, click on the port column next to the desired driver. KStars allows multiple drivers to run under one INDI server, and hence one port. Select multiple drivers then press ``Run Service`` button."
