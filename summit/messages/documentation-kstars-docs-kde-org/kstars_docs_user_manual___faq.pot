#: ../../user_manual/faq.rst:55
msgid "When the display is in motion, KStars must recompute the screen coordinates of every object in its database, which involves some pretty heavy trigonometry.  When scrolling the display (either with the arrow keys or by dragging with the mouse), the display may become slow and jerky, because the computer is having trouble keeping up.  By excluding many of the objects, the computational load is greatly reduced, which allows for smoother scrolling.  You can turn off this feature in the ``Configure - KStars`` window, and you can also configure which objects get hidden."

The problem with high-precision calculations is that you start having to deal with a large number of complicating factors. If you are not a professional astronomer, you will probably never have a problem with its accuracy or precision."

msgid "Planet positions are only accurate for dates within 4000 years or so of the current epoch.  The planet positions are predicted using a Fourier-like analysis of their orbits, as observed over the past few centuries.  We learnt in school that planets follow simple elliptical orbits around the Sun, but this is not strictly true.  It would be true only if there was only one planet in the Solar system, and if the Sun and the planet were both point masses.  As it is, the planets are constantly tugging on each other, perturbing the orbits slightly, and tidal effects also induce precessional wobbling.  In fact, recent analysis suggests that the planets' orbits may not even be stable in the long term (i.e., millions or billions of years).  As a rule of thumb, you can expect the position of a planet to be accurate to a few arcseconds between the dates -2000 and 6000. Pluto is the exception to this; its position is perhaps ten times less precise than the positions of the other planets.  Still, for dates near the present epoch, its position can be trusted to about an arcsecond. The moon's position is the most difficult to predict to high precision. This is because its motion is quite perturbed by the Earth.  Also, since it is so nearby, even minute effects that would be undetectable in more distant bodies are easily apparent in the moon. The objects with the worst long-term precision in the program are the comets and asteroids.  We use a very simplistic orbital model for the minor planets that does not include third-body perturbations. Therefore, their positions can only be trusted for dates near the present epoch.  Even for the present epoch, one can expect positional errors among the minor planets of order 10 arcseconds or more."

#: ../../user_manual/faq.rst:123
msgid "The author of the downloadable NGC/IC catalog has released it with the restriction that it may not be used commercially.  For most KStars users, this is not a problem.  However, it is technically against the KStars license (the GPL) to restrict usage in this way.  We removed the Messier object images from the standard distribution for two reasons:  to simply reduce the size of KStars, and also because of similar licensing concerns with a couple of the images.  The inline images are significantly compressed to a very low quality from their original form, so I doubt there is a real copyright concern, but I did obtain explicit permission from the images' authors to use the few images for which there was any question about it (see :file:`README.images`).  Still, just to be absolutely safe, I removed them from the standard distribution, and marked the download archive as being ``free for non-commercial use``."

msgid "It depends on the image, but many of the images restrict against commercial usage.  The Image Viewer's statusbar will usually contain information about the image's copyright holder, and what usage restrictions apply.  As a rule of thumb:  anything published by NASA is in the public domain (including all HST images).  For everything else, you can pretty safely assume that the images may not be used commercially without permission.  When in doubt, contact the image's copyright holder directly."
