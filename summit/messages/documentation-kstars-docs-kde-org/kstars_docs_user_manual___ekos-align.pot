msgid "The Ekos Alignment Module enables highly accurate GOTOs and can measure and correct polar alignment errors. This is possible thanks to third-party plate-solving technology. The main plate-solving software used is the StellarSolver package, which itself makes use of the offline (and online) astrometry.net, ASTAP and Watney solvers. Ekos begins by capturing an image of a star field, feeding that image to the chosen solver (e.g. see `astrometry.net <https://astrometry.net>`__, `StellarSolver <https://github.com/rlancaste/stellarsolver>`__ or `ASTAP <https://www.hnsky.org/astap>`__), and gets in return the central coordinates (RA, DEC), scale, and orientation of the image. The solver essentially performs pattern recognition against a catalog of millions of stars.  Once the coordinates are determined, the true pointing of the telescope is known."

msgid "Often, there is a discrepancy between where the telescope thinks it is looking at and where it is truly pointing. The magnitude of this discrepancy can range from a few arcminutes to a couple of degrees. Ekos can correct the discrepancy by syncing to the new coordinates, and then slewing the mount to the desired target originally requested."

msgid "Ekos also provides a Polar Alignment Assistant Tool to correct polar alignment errors. It takes three images, slewing between the images, and calculates the offset between the mount axis and polar axis. It feeds back to the user the altitude and azimuth adjustments needed to align these axes. These images are typically taken near the celestial pole (close to Polaris for Northern Hemisphere) but can work well taken from anywhere, usually starting near the meridian and slewing either East or West."

The system doesn't require that the scale be exactly right--it allows deviations of 10-20%. However, frequently issues related to solving are due to an inaccurate scale being used.

Typically you want to enable ``Use Position`` for faster solving, so we recommend you check this box. However, frequently issues related to solving are due to using a poor positional estimate (e.g. the telescope is significantly misaligned). Therefore, if you have plate-solving problems, you may want to uncheck ``Use Position`` until those issues are resolved. As mentioned, this will result in longer solving times. ``Auto-update`` will fill the position box with the position found in the most-recent successful solve.

Of course, actual photons do not behave in this way: optics, atmosphere, seeing quality all scatter and refract photons in one way or another. Furthermore, photons do not arrive uniformly but follow a Poisson distribution. For point-like sources like stars, a point spread function describes how photons are spatially distributed across the pixels. Nevertheless, the *overall* idea we want to keep the source photons hitting the same pixels. Otherwise, we might end up with an image plagued with various trail artifacts."

This can stem from many factors, one of which is the misalignment of the mount's Right Ascension axis with respect to the celestial pole axis. Polar alignment removes one of the biggest sources of tracking errors in the mount, but other sources of error still play a factor. If properly aligned, some mounts can track an object for a few minutes with the only deviation of 1-2 arcsec RMS."

In this scheme the user corrects polar alignment by first adjusting the mount's azimuth knob so that the selected star moves along the yellow side of the triangle.
