To compare the rendered view against a real sky image, click the ``Fetch DSS image`` button to download a DSS image. You can manually adjust the view to match your eyepiece using the rotation slider, the ``Invert view`` and ``Flip view`` check boxes. Alternatively, you can use a pre-calculated amount of rotation by using one item of the ``Preset:`` dropdown box that is tailored for different optical systems."
