msgid "The Ekos Guide Module performs autoguiding using either the powerful built-in guider, or at your option, external guiding via `PHD2 <https://openphdguiding.org/>`__ or `lin_guider <https://sourceforge.net/projects/linguider/>`__. Using the internal guiding, guider camera frames are captured and sent to Ekos for analysis. Depending on the deviations of the stars from their lock positions, guiding pulses corrections are sent to your mount's RA and DEC axes motors. Most of the GUI options in the Guide Module are well documented so just hover your mouse over an item and a tooltip will popup with helpful information."
