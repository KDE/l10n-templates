msgid "The Imaging Planner tool assists users in selecting objects to image. Users can download catalogs of recommended objects, and may create and share their own catalogs. The tool calculates when objects in a catalog may be imaged on the selected night, given constraints such as minimum altitude, terrain, and moon elevation and separation. It can sort the objects along several dimensions including the number of hours an object may be imaged tonight (given the user's geography, constraints and possibly artificial horizon), the object's peak altitude, distance from the moon, constellation, name, and type. Objects can also be filtered out for several reasons (e.g., object type, whether it was previously imaged, keywords, whether the object has been selected, or if the user is uninterested). This tool aids object selection by displaying high-quality images, showing sky locations on the skymap, and providing links to follow to internet sites with more information and images. It allows attaching notes and links to objects, and selecting them for future consideration. This tool can be used with Ekos or other imaging tools, but does not directly interact with the imager; it helps the user decide what to image."
