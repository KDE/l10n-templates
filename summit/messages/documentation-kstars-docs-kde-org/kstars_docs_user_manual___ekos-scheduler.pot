msgid "The Ekos Scheduler is an important component of your imaging workflow. It connects to INDI, starts and stops all the other Ekos modules, schedules jobs according to their constraints and priorities, monitors those jobs as they execute, and then safely brings down the system when jobs are done, or before dawn. Whether you are running multi-day imaging sessions for multiple targets, or simply trying to image a single target for a few hours, it is advisable to have the Scheduler control your imaging sessions."

msgid "Among the settings shown above, one important one is known as ``Remember job progress``. When this box is checked and a job is running, the Scheduler looks at the job's images already captured on disk, and doesn't re-capture the ones that are already there. The benefit is that if a job is restarted, or re-run another night, or if multiple jobs are being run together, stopping and starting when they are runnable, then jobs re-start right where they left off. This works well with the ``Repeat until terminated`` job-completion option. If ``Remember job progress`` is unchecked, jobs would restart from the start of their sequence specification each time, which probably isn't what you want. Unfortunately, if the images are not stored on the same computer that Ekos is running on, then this feature doesn't work and the jobs restart from their beginning."

msgid "Normally the (Greedy) scheduler's job priority is set by the row the job is listed in the Scheduler's job table. Jobs on rows closer to the top run with higher priority than jobs lower down.

msgid "If you wish to alternate jobs, you can assign each of the jobs the same ``group`` name, and give the jobs one of the repeating finish conditions (e.g. Repeat for N times, or Repeat Until Terminated). With that setup, jobs in the same group will cede to each other if they have completed more 'Repeat Iterations' than the other job. So, if Job2 with group \"MyGroup\" completes its 2nd iteration, and Job3 with the same group name has only completed 0 or 1 iterations, when the time comes to schedule Job2, Job3 will run instead."

msgid "Practically speaking, imagine you had a 6-panel mosaic you wanted to alternate. You might give all of those jobs the same group name, make them all e.g. \"Repeat for 5 times\". Then, they would run in lock-step. The cadence of job switching would be controlled by the length of the sequence file assigned to each of those jobs. You wouldn't want to make the cadence too short (e.g. capturing one 2-minute image), as there is overhead in switching jobs. For instance, starting jobs may involved aligning, starting guiding, and even focusing."

The Capture Sequence Editor, which is not connected to the device drivers, does not have direct access to this information. Instead, the editor uses the values from the last time the capture tab connected to its devices.

For instance, a 4x4 mosaic grid with 75% overlap has 16 sub-frames covering the central intersection, which is enough for Winsorized Sigma rejection.
