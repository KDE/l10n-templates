msgid "The FITS Viewer Solver is used to plate-solve the image loaded in the FITS Viewer's tab. It only works with the internal StellarSolver. You get the RA and DEC coordinates for the center of the image, the image's scale, the angle of rotation, and the number of stars detected in the image. Its main use case is debugging plate-solving issues in Ekos, though the information displayed can be generally useful. The controls and displays are described below."

msgid "Scale: Checking the Use Scale checkbox constrains the solver to use approximately the pixel or image scale given. The scale is entered in the box and the units for the scale can be chosen from image width in degrees, image width in arc-minutes, and arc-seconds per pixel. When a solve successfully completes, it replaces the value in the box with solution's scale."

msgid "Position: Checking the Use Position checkbox constrains the solver to search near the RA and DEC coordinates given. The extent of the search is given by the user in the Radius box in degrees. Note that RA is input in hours-minutes-seconds, e.g. 13h, and DEC is input in degrees-minutes-seconds, e.g. 85. When a solve successfully completes, it replaces the value in the RA and DEC boxes with solution's coordinates. In addition it fills in the Angle field with the solutions angle value in degrees."
