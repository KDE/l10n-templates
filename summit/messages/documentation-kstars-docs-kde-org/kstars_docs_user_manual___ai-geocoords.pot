msgid "Locations on Earth can be specified using a spherical coordinate system. The geographic (“earth-mapping”) coordinate system is aligned with the spin axis of the Earth. It defines two angles measured from the center of the Earth. One angle, called the *Latitude*, measures the angle between any point and the Equator. The other angle, called the *Longitude*, measures the angle *along* the Equator from an arbitrary point on the Earth (Greenwich, England is the accepted zero-longitude point in most modern societies)."

msgid "By combining these two angles, any location on Earth can be specified. For example, Baltimore, Maryland (USA) has a latitude of 39.3 degrees North, and a longitude of 76.6 degrees West. So, a vector drawn from the center of the Earth to a point 39.3 degrees above the Equator and 76.6 degrees west of Greenwich, England will pass through Baltimore."

msgid "The Equator is obviously an important part of this coordinate system; it represents the *zeropoint* of the latitude angle, and the halfway point between the poles. The Equator is the *Fundamental Plane* of the geographic coordinate system. :doc:`All Spherical Coordinate Systems  <ai-skycoords>` define such a Fundamental Plane."

msgid "Lines of constant Latitude are called *Parallels*. They trace circles on the surface of the Earth, but the only parallel that is a :doc:`Great Circle  <ai-greatcircle>` is the Equator (Latitude=0 degrees). Lines of constant Longitude are called *Meridians*. The Meridian passing through Greenwich is the *Prime Meridian* (longitude=0 degrees). Unlike Parallels, all Meridians are great circles, and Meridians are not parallel: they intersect at the north and south poles."
