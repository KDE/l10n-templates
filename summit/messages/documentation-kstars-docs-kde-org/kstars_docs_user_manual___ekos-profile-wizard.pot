msgid "In case selected the 2nd option in the last step, you shall be presented with the Remote Connect Page, here you will enter the hostname or IP address of the StellarMate unit. You can get the hostname from the StellarMate mobile App. Alternatively, you can construct the hostname from StellarMate HotSpot SSID. You should see the SSID when you search for WiFi networks nearby. For example, suppose the SSID is ``stellarmate``. The hostname should be *stellarmate.local*. That is, if you remove the underscore, and append *.local*, then you will get the unit hostname. You can always use the StellarMate App to change the unit default hostname to the name of your choice."
