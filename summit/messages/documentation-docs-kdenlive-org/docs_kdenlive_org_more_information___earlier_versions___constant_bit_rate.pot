msgid "When a constant bitrate (CBR) profile is selected, the :menuselection:`File Size` section displays a drop down for choosing the **Video bitrate** you want. This is similar to the version <=0.9.8 behaviour of **Kdenlive**. You select the video bitrate you want and the video is encoded at that video bitrate across its entire length."
