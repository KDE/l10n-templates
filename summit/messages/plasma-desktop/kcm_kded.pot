"<p>This module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the KDE Daemon, also referred to as KDE Services. Generally, there are two types of service:</p>"
" "
"<ul>"
"<li>Services invoked at startup</li>"
"<li>Services called on demand</li>"
"</ul>"
" "
"<p>The latter are only listed for convenience. The startup services can be started and stopped. You can also define whether services should be loaded at startup.</p>"
" "
"<p><b>Use this with care: some services are vital for Plasma; do not deactivate services if you  do not know what you are doing.</b></p>"
