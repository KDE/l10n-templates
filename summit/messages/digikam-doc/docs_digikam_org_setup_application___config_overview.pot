To access these settings select either :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure digiKam...` from the menu-bar, or if you are on a Mac, :menuselection:`digiKam --> Preferences...`. The configuration dialog is separated into categories displayed on independent pages. You can switch pages by clicking on the icons on the left-hand side of the dialog."
