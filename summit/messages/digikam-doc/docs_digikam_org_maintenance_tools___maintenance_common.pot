msgid "In the **Common Options** section you can restrict the scope of the maintenance process(es) to certain albums or tags. You can un-check **Whole albums collection** or **Whole tags collection** to get access to the drop down fields where you can select specific albums or tags. Note that a context menu in this drop down field allows you to select or deselect children and/or parents and also to invert the selection. If you switch from **Albums** to **Tags** or vice versa your selection in the now grayed out item will remain untouched which might be useful if you need to reuse a certain selection."
