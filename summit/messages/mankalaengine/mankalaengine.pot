"Bohnenspiel is played on a board with 2 rows, each with 6 holes, and 2 end-holes, called stores. Each player owns the store to their right hand and controls the holes on their side of the board.\n"
"At the beginning, all holes are filled with 6 counters. The starting player chooses one of the holes under their control and removes all counters in it. The player goes through the holes next to the chosen one anticlockwise, placing one counter in each one until they have no more counters in their hand. Both stores are skipped. This is called sowing.\n"
"If the last counter falls into a hole, bringing the total number of counters in the hole to 2, 4, or 6, these counters are captured and put in the player's store. When a capture is made, the preceding hole is checked and captured according to the same rule. The captures are repeated until the previous hole has some number of counters other than 2, 4, or 6.\n"
"The game ends when a player cannot move anymore; the remaining seeds on the board are given to the opposing player, and the winner is the one with more seeds."

"Oware is played on a board with 2 rows, each with 6 holes, and 2 end-holes, called stores. Each player owns the store to their right hand and controls the holes on their side of the board.\n"
"At the beginning, all holes are filled with 4 counters. The starting player chooses one of the holes under their control and removes all counters in it. The player goes through the holes next to the chosen one anticlockwise, placing one counter in each one until they have no more counters in their hand. Both stores are skipped and the starting hole is always left empty, so it will also be skipped if there were 12 or more counters inside it. This is called sowing.\n"
"If the last counter falls into a hole controlled by the oponent, bringing the total number of counters in the hole to 2 or 3, these counters are captured and put in the player's store. When a capture is made, the preceding hole is checked and captured according to the same rule. The captures are repeated until the previous hole does not belong to the opponent or it has some number of counters other than 2 or 3. The only exception to this is when a Grand Slam occurs. A Grand Slam is a move that would capture all of the opponent's counters, and in this case no counters are captured, as this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game.\n"
"This is related to a more general rule, that states that a player should make moves that allow the opponent to continue playing. If the opponent's holes are all empty, the player should make a move that places pebbles in the opponent's side of the board. If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in their own territory, ending the game.\n"
"The game ends when a player has 25 or more counters in their store."

"Pallanguli is played with a rectangular board that has two rows and 7 pits on each side, along with pebbles/coins.\n"
"To begin, each pit is filled with 6 coins (the number of coins varies). The first player picks up coins from one of the pits and starts to drop them in an anti-clockwise direction in each succeeding pit. If the player reaches the last pit in the row, he/she continues on their opponent's side. Once the last coin is dropped, the player takes the coin from the next pit and continues playing in the same way. If the last coin falls into a pit where the next pit is empty, the coins in the pit beyond the empty pit are captured and stored by the player. The player continues playing from the next cup containing coins. If the last coin falls into a pit with two empty holes beyond, the player's turn comes to an end. The opponent now continues to play in the same way, taking coins from any of their pits and going around dropping the coins in a counter-clockwise direction. If, after dropping a pebble into a pit, the pit contains four coins, these coins are also captured by the player.\n"
"The round is over when no coins remain."

"Kalah is played on a board with 2 rows, each with 6 holes, and 2 end-holes, called kalahs. Each player owens the store to their right hand and controls the holes on their side of the board.\n"
"At the beginning, all holes are filled with 6 beans  and the kalahs are empty. The starting player chooses one of the holes on their side and removes all the beans in it. The player goes through the holes next to the chosen one  anticlockwise, placing one bean in each one until they have no more beans left. The opponent's kalah is skipped. This is called sowing. If after sowing, the last bean falls in the player's kalah, the player must move again. Otherwise, the move is over.\n"
"If the last bean falls into an empty hole controlled by the player and the hole controlled by the opponent opposite to it has beans in it, then all the beans in both the holes are removed and moved to the player's kalah. This is called capturing.\n"
"The game ends when a player has more than 36 beans in their kalah."
