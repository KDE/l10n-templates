You do not need to do anything special to use this feature, just select an object from a diagram (Class, Actor, &etc;) and copy it (<keycombo>&Ctrl;<keycap>C</keycap></keycombo>, or using the menu), then open a <application>Calligra Words</application> document (or any program into which you can paste images) and select <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem>. This is a great feature to export parts of your diagram as simple pictures."
