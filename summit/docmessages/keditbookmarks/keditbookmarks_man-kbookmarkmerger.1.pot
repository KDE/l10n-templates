msgid "&kbookmarkmerger; is a program for merging a given set of bookmarks into the user's set of bookmarks; if the user doesn't have any bookmarks created yet, a new bookmark list is created and the given bookmarks are inserted into it. While doing this, &kbookmarkmerger; keeps track of which files were merged in a previous run already, so no bookmark will get installed to the user's bookmarks more than once."

msgid "The traditionally used approach to achieve something like this was to use carefully crafted skeleton home directories when creating a new user account, to provide the user with a standard set of bookmarks. The problem with this approach is that after the user account has been created, no new bookmarks can be propagated."

msgid "This mechanism is useful for system administrators who want to propagate a bookmark pointing to a certain document (for instance, important notes about the system) to all users. Distributors might find it useful as well, for instance by augmenting the software packages they supply with bookmark files which &kbookmarkmerger; merges into the user's bookmark list when the package is installed. That way, documentation shipped with a software package is easily and visibly accessible right after the package has been installed."
