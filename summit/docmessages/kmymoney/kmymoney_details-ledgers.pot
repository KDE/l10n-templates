msgid "The Ledgers View is functionally the data integration center of &kmymoney;. This view is for entering, examining, editing, and deleting transactions in your defined accounts. This view has had a major overhaul since the 5.1 series of &kmymoney; releases. The main difference is that it is now a tabbed display, so you can have more than one account displayed at once. You can actually only see one at a time, but switching by simply clicking a different tab is significantly more convenient than having to select the other account in a dropdown."

Specifically, it is important not to delete the imported transaction, because you will find that the next time you import your transactions, the deleted transaction may show up again. This is because modern import formats like OFX and HBCI use a <quote>Transaction ID</quote> to identify transactions. When you delete the imported transaction, the transaction ID goes with it, so the importer has no way to know this transaction was already imported. For CSV and QIF imports, &kmymoney; creates an identifier for each transaction that is intended to serve the same purpose."
