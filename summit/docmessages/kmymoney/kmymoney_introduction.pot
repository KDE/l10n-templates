msgid "As a personal finance manager, &kmymoney; is not intended to support the needs of a business. A small business might find sufficient functionality to use &kmymoney;, but features such as accounts-receivable and accounts-payable are not directly supported. The larger the business, the less likely it is to find &kmymoney; will meet its financial management needs. Most if not all the data needed for a small business, such as for reports for audit and taxation purposes is present, but may need to be extracted using various reports and then processed and assembled into the required formats. In addition, it would be possible to create client, supplier, document, or other features through plugins."
