If you choose <guilabel>Synchronize</guilabel> from the toolbar, any zoom and panning in one window will be synchronously executed in the other pane, so that you can compare the same areas of two images."

If you choose <guilabel>By Pair</guilabel> from the toolbar, the first two images will be automatically inserted into the comparison panes. Click on any thumbnail to make it the left side preview, the adjacent thumbnail to the right will be inserted into the right pane. That make it easy to sift through a series of similar images."
