msgid "In the first field you can choose the file format used for saving the intermediate steps and the final result. Remember that JPEG - like in the screenshot above - is a lossy format. So if you need to start over from an intermediate step it wouldn't be really non-destructive. If you can afford it in terms of space on the harddisk and loading/saving speed you better choose a lossless format like PNG or PCF for instance. Please click the information button on the right side for more detailed information."
