"Most current digital cameras produce images with several brightly colored &quot;bad pixels&quot; when using slow shutter speeds. Night images can be ruined by these &quot;bad pixels&quot;. There are three different types of &quot;bad pixels&quot;: "
"<itemizedlist> "
"<listitem> "
"<para>Stuck pixels: it's a pixel that always reads high or is always on to maximum power on all exposures. This produces a bright pixel usually of red, blue or green color in the final image. A stuck pixel will occur regardless of shutter speed, aperture size or any other user settings. It will occur on a normal exposure and tends to be more obvious under bright condition.</para>"
" </listitem>"

"<listitem> "
"<para>Dead pixels: it's a pixel that reads zero or is always off on all exposures. This state produces a black pixel in the final image. Similar to stuck pixel, a dead pixel will occur regardless of shutter speed, aperture size or any other user settings.</para>"

"<listitem> "
"<para>Hot pixels: it's a pixel that reads high (bright) on longer exposures as white, red, or green color. The longer the exposure time, the more visible hot pixels will become. These pixels will not be visible in bright conditions.</para>"

" Note that stuck or dead pixels will occur at the same location for all images. If the location of the stuck or dead pixel occurs at different locations, it may be a Hot Pixel."

msgid "The Black Frame subtraction method is the most accurate &quot;Hot Pixels&quot; and &quot;Stuck Pixels&quot; removal. First you have to create a &quot;Black Frame&quot; as a reference. This is easy to do. When you finish taking your long exposure shots, put a lens cap on the camera and take one &quot;dark&quot; image with the same exposure time as the images before. This image will be all dark, but with close examination you will see that it has the Hot and Stuck Pixels (colored dots). These are positioned at the same places as on your previous shots."
