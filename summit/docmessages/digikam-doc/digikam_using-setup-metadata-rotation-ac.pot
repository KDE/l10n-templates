msgid "<guilabel>Show images/thumbnails rotated according to orientation tag</guilabel> : this will use any orientation information that your camera has included in the EXIF information to automatically rotate your photographs so that they are the correct way up when displayed. It will not actually rotate the image file, only the display of the image on the screen. If you want to permanently rotate the image on file, you can click with the &RMB; on the thumbnail and select <guilabel>Auto-rotate/flip according to EXIF orientation</guilabel>. The image will then be rotated on disk and the tag will be reset to \"normal\". If your camera routinely gets this orientation information wrong you might like to switch this feature off."

msgid "<guilabel>Set orientation tag to normal after rotate/flip</guilabel> : the Auto Rotate option automatically corrects the orientation of images taken with digital cameras that have an orientation sensor. The camera adds an orientation tag to the image's EXIF metadata. &digikam; can read this tag to adjust the image accordingly. If you manually rotate an image, these metadata will be incorrect. This option will set the orientation tag to \"Normal\" after an adjustment, assuming that you rotated it to the correct orientation. Switch this off if you don't want &digikam; to make changes to the orientation tag, when you rotate or flip the image."
