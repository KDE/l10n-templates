To crop a photograph simply drag a rectangle over the image by holding down the &LMB; and moving the mouse. You will see a wire frame rectangle appear as you move the mouse."

These proportions are close to the golden rule and are derived from the field of view of the human eye. They are often used with slight variations throughout a large number of commonly used objects.

The same principle is used to determine the position of the horizon and the proportion of ground to sky."

msgid "Many photographers and artists are aware of the Rule of Thirds, where an image is divided into three sections vertically and horizontally and the points of intersection represent places to position important visual elements. Moving a horizon in a landscape to the position of one third is often more effective than placing it in the middle, but it could also be placed near the bottom one quarter or sixth. There is nothing obligatory about applying the Rule of Thirds. In placing visual elements for effective composition, one must assess many factors including color, dominance, size and balance together with proportion. Often a certain amount of image balance or tension can make a composition more effective."
