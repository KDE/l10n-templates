msgid "A <ulink url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosaicing\">demosaicing</ulink> algorithm is a digital image process used to interpolate a complete image from the partial raw data received from the color-filtered image sensor internal to many digital cameras in form of a matrix of colored pixels. Also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction."

msgid "The default is to assume that all green pixels are the same. If even-row green pixels of the CCD sensor are more sensitive to ultraviolet light than odd-row this difference causes a mesh pattern in the output; using this option solves this problem with minimal loss of detail. To resume, this option blurs the image a little, but it eliminates false 2x2 mesh patterns with VNG quality method or mazes with AHD quality method."

This is because in &digikam; 0 and 1 are the \"solid white\" and \"unclip\" options in the drop down menu (if you select these, the level slider will be grayed out). Therefore, the slider in &digikam; with the \"reconstruct\" option will let you choose between 0 to 7 (instead of 0 to 9 in Dcraw command line) where 3 is the compromise instead of 5 in \"native\" Dcraw command line tool."

msgid "TODO While demosaicing your image you can additionally ask for noise reduction (at a slight speed penalty). This option applies a noise reduction algorithm while the image still is in CIE Lab color space. Because the noise is only applied to the Luminosity layer (the \"L\" of the Lab), it should not blur your image as traditional noise reduction algorithms do in RGB mode. So, if you converted an image from RAW and it appears noisy, rather than applying a denoiser, go back and re-convert with this option enabled. The defaults are: <emphasis>Threshold</emphasis> = 100. Higher values will increase the smoothing, lower will decrease smoothing."
