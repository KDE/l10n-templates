The second you would choose if you want the images already scanned to be included in the next scan. The third is more interesting in the context of Face Recognition since <quote>unconfirmed results</quote> means face tags that don't have a name assigned to them yet."

msgid "Assigning People tags to face tags is an important prerequisite to Face Recognition. Very obviously &digikam; can only recognize faces if it has something to compare with. So it's up to you to show it the ropes, which means in this case to tell &digikam;: This is Lara, this is Juan, this is Peter and so forth. For that you would, after performing a Face Detection as described in the previous article, typically select the <quote>unknown</quote> tag on the Left Sidebar, click on a thumbnail and click, if necessary, on the <inlinemediaobject> <imageobject><imagedata fileref=\"&path;using-mainwindow-icon-showfacetags.png\" format=\"PNG\"/></imageobject> </inlinemediaobject> (Show Face Tags) button. Now you should see the face tags of that photograph. Those which have a people (or other) tag already assigned will simply show the name of that tag. The others, showing <quote>unknown</quote> faces, will show a field and two buttons as in the screenshot of the previous article. In the field labeled \"Who is this?\" you can either type in the name of an existing People tag out of your tag tree or use the drop down function to show your tag tree and select a tag. With <guilabel>Confirm</guilabel> you can save that to the database."

One reason can be that there are too many face tags assigned to a person which shows this person in a way that doesn't really help the search algorithm, &eg; with sunglasses, blurred, unusual colors, carnival make up, dark shaded areas in the face, baby/kid/adult photographs mixed... Another reason to use that option can be false face recognition due to a wrong accuracy setting in the <guilabel>Parameters</guilabel> tab."
