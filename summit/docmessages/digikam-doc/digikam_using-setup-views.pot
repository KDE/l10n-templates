msgid "Instead of opening the image in the editor, the &digikam; preview mode (<keycap>F3</keycap>) will show the image within the main window in the Image Area. The advantage of the preview is that it is faster than opening the image editor and that the icons of the other images remain visible so that you are able to review the list of current images quickly. Depending on your computer features, you can customize the best way to load images into the preview. Raw files can be processed differently, as this kind of container can require long computation."
