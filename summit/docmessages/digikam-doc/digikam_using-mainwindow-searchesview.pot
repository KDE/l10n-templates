You can enter any arguments in the <guilabel>Search:</guilabel> text field and it will be used to determine the results. For instance, you can enter the string 'birthday' to search the complete database for occurrences of the word 'birthday' in all metadata text fields, or '05.png' to search for a specific image file name '05.png' (no escaping as in regexpressions needed)."

Depending on the kind of data each field contains different input fields for your search, sometimes more than one type for the same field. Simplest are selection buttons, &eg; for colors. Then you have plain fields of the <quote>The <replaceable>field content</replaceable> contains</quote> type, drop down lists and checkboxes. Many fields have two input fields allowing you to define a range, &eg; <quote>Find pictures with a width between</quote>. And often you find a link type thing called <quote>Any</quote> which opens a drop down field with checkboxes for the possible contents of that field."

If you hit this button another list with the same categories of search fields will open below the first one (scroll down in case you don't see it right away) separated by a blue header showing the same options we were just talking about. On top of them you see an underlined OR meaning that this list is connected to the first one by boolean OR. You can change that to AND by clicking on it."

msgid "To explain how it works let's make another example based on one of those we had already. I want to use the second one. That means: in the first group you checked <quote>Meet Any of the following conditions</quote> and you selected Album name <quote>Holidays</quote> and color <quote>red</quote>. As we said already this will produce all pictures labeled with <quote>red</quote> out of your whole collection <emphasis>and</emphasis> the content of the Album <quote>Holidays</quote>. Now let's assume for some reason you want to exclude all rejected files and all files with a rating lower than three stars. So you open a second group, click on the underlined OR in the header in order to change it to AND, select <quote>None of these conditions are met</quote>, fold out the <quote>Picture Properties</quote>, check under <quote>Labels</quote> the red flag (rejected) and select under <quote>Rating</quote> no star (five white stars) in the first field and two stars in the second field. Note that there is a difference between <quote>no star</quote> and <quote>No Rating assigned</quote>! If you want to exclude the pictures without any rating as well you got to open another Search Group, click on the underlined OR in the header in order to change it to AND, select <quote>None of these conditions are met</quote> and select <quote>No Rating assigned</quote> in the <quote>Picture Properties</quote> category."

msgid "Which brings us to the fact that you can open as many additional Search Groups as you need to formulate your query. But since the purpose of this handbook is not to open a competition in creating the most sophisticated queries I leave it to you to figure out how far you have to go or can go in this respect and rather finish this section with a few hints about the other buttons in the Advanced Search Tool. Beside the <guilabel>+ Add Search Group</guilabel> button you see <guilabel>Reset</guilabel>. This removes all additional Search Groups and clears all the fields in the remaining one. It's a good policy to use this button before starting to create a new search, in particular when you leave the Advanced Search Tool with the intention to use the Quick Search for your next query, because otherwise the search criteria remain active even if you don't see them and screw up your new search. <guilabel>Try</guilabel> carries out the search but leaves the Advanced Search Tool window open, <guilabel>OK</guilabel> does the same but closes the window. <quote>Remove Group</quote> in the header of the additional Search Groups doesn't need an explanation, I think."
