msgid "After all, the camera profile should provide the best \"fit\" to the colors recorded by my camera, as processed by my raw processing procedure, right? Wikipedia says, \"Working spaces, such as sRGB or Adobe RGB, are color spaces that facilitate good results while editing. For instance, pixels with equal values of RGB should appear neutral.\" \"[P]ixels with equal values of RGB should appear neutral\" just means that for any given pixel in an image that has been converted to a suitable working space, if R=G=B you should see grey or black or white on your screen. Many camera profiles violate this \"neutral\" condition. I am not aware of a list of other technical requirements for a suitable working space. However, I can think of another good reason why you wouldn't want to edit your image in your camera profile color space. If you look at the size of a typical camera profile, it is on the order of a quarter to a half a megabyte or more. It's got a lot of information about all the changes that need to be made at different regions of color and tonality in the original scene, to get accurate color rendition from the RGB values that come out of the raw processor. The camera profile is accurate (at least for colors in the original target) but not particularly mathematically smooth. Working space color profiles, on the other hand, are very small in size (half a kilobyte instead of half a megabyte) because they describe a color gamut in terms of smooth, continuous mathematical functions. Working space profiles don't need to make allowances for the \"messiness\" of real world sensors, so the mathematical manipulations performed during image editing will go much more smoothly and accurately than if you try to edit your image while it is still in the camera color space."

msgid "The gamma of a color profile dictates what power transform needs to take place to properly convert from an image's embedded color profile (perhaps your working color space or your camera color profile) to another color profile with a different gamma, such as your chosen working space, or the display profile used to display the image on the screen or perhaps from one working space to another, or perhaps from your working space to your printer's color space. Dcraw outputs a 16-bit image with a linear gamma, which means that a histogram of the resulting image file shows the actual amount of light that each pixel on the camera sensor captured during the exposure (paraphrasing <ulink url=\"http://www.guillermoluijk.com/tutorial/dcraw/index_en.htm\">this page</ulink>). (Which is why at present applying a camera profile to the dcraw output also requires applying an appropriate gamma transform to get to the desired working space, unless the camera profile also uses gamma=1.)"

msgid "One practical consequence of the gamma of a working space is that the higher the gamma, the more discrete tones are available for editing in the shadows, with consequently fewer tones available in the highlights. Changing the gamma of an image redistributes the number of tones available in the lighter and darker areas of an image. Theoretically, if you are working on a very dark-toned (low key) image you might want a working space with a higher gamma. And if you are working on a high key image, say a picture taken in full noon sunlight of a wedding dress with snow as a backdrop, you might want to choose a working space with a lower gamma, so you have more available tonal gradations in the highlights."

msgid "sRGB uses a transfer function close to that of a CRT (and thus not necessarily relevant to image editing or to display on an LCD). As Wikipedia notes, \"Unlike most other RGB color spaces the sRGB gamma can not be expressed as a single numerical value. The overall gamma is approximately 2.2, consisting of a linear (gamma 1.0) section near black, and a non-linear section elsewhere involving a 2.4 exponent and a gamma (slope of log output versus log input) changing from 1.0 through about 2.3\" (cited from <ulink url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB\">this page</ulink>), which makes for some complicated math during image processing."

As noted above, dcraw outputs linear gamma files if you ask for 16-bit output. Linear gamma is used in HDR (high dynamic range) imaging and also if one wants to avoid introducing gamma-induced errors into one's regular low dynamic range editing."

But see \"Gamma errors in picture scaling\" (cited from <ulink url=\"http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/gamma.html\">this page</ulink>) for gamma-induced tonality shifts; and of course see Timo Autiokari's informative (albeit somewhat infamous) website for a whole-hearted endorsement of using linear gamma working spaces (Timo's website seems to be down at present, though archived copies of his articles are still available through google). Bruce Lindbloom mentions a commonly-encountered gamma-induced error that is caused by incorrectly calculating luminance in a nonlinear RGB working space (see <ulink url=\"http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?WorkingSpaceInfo.html\">this page</ulink>, sidenote 1). And in a similar vein, the calculations involved in mixing colors together to produce new colors (such as using a digital filter to add warmth to an image) result in gamma errors unless the new colors are calculated by first transforming all the relevant values back to their linear values."

msgid "Unfortunately and despite their undeniable mathematical advantages, linear gamma working spaces have so few tones in the shadows that (in my opinion) they are impossible to use for editing if one is working in 8-bits, and still problematic at 16-bits. When the day comes when we are all doing our editing on 32-bit files produced by our HDR cameras on our personal supercomputers, I predict that we will all be using working spaces with gamma=1. Adobe Lightroom is already using a linear gamma working space \"under the hood\", CS2 allows the option of using linear gamma for mixing colors, and Lightzone has always used a linear gamma working space."

msgid "In an 8-bit image, you have 256 tonal steps from solid black to solid white. In a 16-bit image theoretically you have 65536 steps. But remember, those 16-bits started out as either 10 bits (=1024 steps), 12 bits (=4096 steps), or 14 bits (=16384 steps) as produced by the camera's A-to-D converter - the extra bits to reach 16-bits start out as just padding. The available tones are not distributed evenly from light to dark. In linear gamma mode (as the camera sensor sees things), there's a whole lot more tones in the highlights than in the shadows. Hence the advice, if you shoot raw, to \"expose to the right but don't blow the highlights\". See Ron Bigelow's <ulink url=\"http://www.ronbigelow.com/articles/articles.htm\">articles on \"why raw\"</ulink>, for a full discussion of the distribution of available tones in a raw image."

msgid "One major consideration in choosing a working space is that some working spaces are bigger than others, meaning they cover more of the visible spectrum (and as a consequence include some imaginary colors - mathematical constructs that don't really exist). These bigger spaces offer the advantage of allowing you to keep all the colors captured by your camera and preserved by the LCMS conversion from your camera profile to the super-wide-gamut profile connection space and out again to your chosen working space."

msgid "But keeping all the possible colors comes at a price, as explained below. And it seems that any given digital image likely only contains a small subset of all the possible visible colors that your camera is capable of capturing. This small subset is easily contained in one of the smaller working spaces (an exception requiring a larger color gamut would be a picture of a highly saturated object such as yellow daffodil)."

msgid "Using a very large working space means that editing your image (applying curves, increasing saturation, &etc;) can easily produce colors that your eventual output device (printer, monitor) simply cannot reproduce (you cannot see these colors while you're editing, either). So the conversion from your working space to your output device space (say your printer) will have to remap the out-of-gamut colors in your edited image, some of which might even be totally imaginary, to your printer color space with its much smaller color gamut. This remapping process will lead to inaccurate colors and loss of saturation at best. Even worse, the remapping can easily lead to banding (posterization - gaps in what should be a smooth color transition, say, across an expanse of blue sky) and clipping (&eg; your carefully crafted muted transitions across delicate shades of red, for example, might get remapped to a solid block of dull red after conversion to your printer's color space). Also, the experts say that 8-bit images just don't have enough tones to stretch across a wide gamut working space without banding and loss of saturation, even before conversion to an output space. So if you choose a large gamut working space, make sure you start with a 16-bit image."
