The top item <quote>Albums</quote> just shows the <quote>welcome to &digikam;</quote> screen in the view area. The next level of the <quote>Albums</quote> tree shows your different Collections (marked by the <inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref=\"&path;using-mainwindow-icon-collection.png\" format=\"PNG\"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject> icon) or at least one if you haven't added one or more yet in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Configure &digikam;...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> Collections section. Each Collection represents a folder branch on your hard disk, on removable media or on network shares and the next levels in the tree show the structure of those folders, here called <quote>Albums</quote>. The albums can be sorted by their folder layout on the hard disk, by the Category that has been set in the <link linkend=\"albumpropsedit.anchor\">Album Properties</link> or by the Date of that Albums (this date can also be changed in the Properties of each Album). You can invert the sort order (ascending/descending) by clicking on the title bar of the album tree."

An Album will be created with the same name as the hard disk folder. You can use drag and drop to import a folder. Drag a folder icon, for example from a &dolphin; window. Then drop it on the album list on the left. A menu will appear that gives you the option to move or copy the folder into &digikam;."
