msgid "With the <guilabel>String comparison type</guilabel> setting, you can set the way in which strings are compared inside &digikam;. This influences the sorting of the tree views. <guilabel>Natural</guilabel> tries to compare strings in a way that regards some normal conventions. The result will be sort naturally even if they have a different number of digits inside. <guilabel>Normal</guilabel> uses a more technical approach. Use this style if you want to entitle albums with ISO dates (201006 or 20090523) and the albums should be sorted according to these dates."
