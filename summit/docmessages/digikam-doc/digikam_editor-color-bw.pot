msgid "Black &amp; White photography has always been fascinating in its abstraction capability. With the advent of digital photography, B&amp;W has almost become a desktop activity, as color images can be easily converted on the computer into black and white, even providing a set of vintage film roll profiles. This filter is also able to simulates traditional infrared film material."

msgid "&digikam; comes with a couple of black &amp; white filters that you can use on your photographs. Under the <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Color</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Black &amp; White...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu you will find classic black &amp; white chemical toning used in analog photography. The controls come on four drop-down items: <emphasis>Film, Lens Filters, Tone</emphasis> and <emphasis>Lightness</emphasis> as shown on the screenshot below. Film, filters and color toning can be applied independently of each other (on top of each other). The filters actually influence the RGB channel mixing, whereas the toning purely adds a uniform monochromatic tint to the black &amp; white photograph. In the lightness tab you will find a tonal adjustment tool (like curve adjust), a contrast tool and an over-exposure indicator to improve the b&amp;w rendering."

msgid "Simulating classical infrared film material (the effect is rendered in black and white) is an interesting alienation effect that is even stronger and more dramatic than pure black and white conversion. Contrast and an abstract touch are improved, which can underpin the expression of the photographer as an artist. It is like taking an image in black and white with a red filter on the camera lense. Areas which reflect little red light, &eg; the sky, will show as low density, dark areas. Areas which are excellent reflectors of red light, &eg; most green foliage, will be high density areas. And snow landscapes are really dramatic."

The ISO-level slider modifies the amount of filmgrain added and the predominance of green color (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion mixer. Green pastures will become white as snow! Try it out."
