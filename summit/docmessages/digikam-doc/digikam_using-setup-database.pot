msgid "<ulink url=\"https://sqlite.org\">SQLite</ulink> is a relational database management system, contained in C programming library. SQLite is not directly comparable to client/server SQL database engines such as MySQL, Oracle or PostgreSQL. Rather, it is an embedded SQL database engine, &ie; it is embedded in an end program. SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files. For device-local storage with low writer concurrency and less than a terabyte of content, SQLite is almost always a better solution. SQLite is fast and reliable and it requires no configuration or maintenance. It keeps things simple. SQLite \"just works\"."
