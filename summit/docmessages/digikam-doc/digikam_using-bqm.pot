msgid "There are ome considerations before your convert, and even before you shoot in raw format. RAW image file formats keep the original information of the exposure supposedly without loss (when compressed, they use reversible, lossless compressions algorithms). Many photographers prefer to take their picture in RAW mode because the camera's built-in conversion program is often of lesser quality than what you can achieve with digital image processing. The whitebalance of the digital camera is registered but not applied to the image. Some CMOS CCD's create four types of color filter data: RGBG, Red, Green, Blue and another Green mask for contrast enhancement. This tool can take this into account."

The first checkbox indicates to use the camera settings for white balance. The essential parameters like brightness, and red/blue amplifier may be adjusted. If the result is not quite optimal, don't worry, it is always possible to fine-tune the image later on."
