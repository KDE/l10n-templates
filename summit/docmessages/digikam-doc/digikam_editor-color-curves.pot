msgid "The Adjust Curves tool is the most sophisticated tool available to adjust the images' tonality. Start it from the <menuchoice><guimenu>Color</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Curves Adjust...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> Image Editor menu. It allows you to click and drag control points on a curve to create a free function mapping input brightness levels to output brightness levels. The Adjust Curves tool can replicate any effect you can achieve with Brightness/Contrast/Gamma or the Adjust Levels tool, though it is more powerful than either one of them. But this tool can do more for you, it helps you to improve the tonal quality of your photographs to very finely stepped gray scales. And do not forget that the better the photographs are (good exposure, lossless format, 24 or 32 bit deep) the more you can improve them. Navigate to the \"Achieving ultimate tonal quality\" section of this instructive page: <ulink url=\"http://www.normankoren.com/digital_tonality.html\">Tonal quality and dynamic range in digital cameras by Norman Koren</ulink>. Use Adjust Curves tool to do just the same!"

msgid "This tool provides visual curves to modify the intensity values of the active layer displayed as a histogram non-linearily. In <guilabel>Curve smooth mode</guilabel>, you change the curves shape by adding new points to the curve or by moving end point positions. Another way, is to draw all the curve manually in <guilabel>Curve free mode</guilabel>. In both cases the effect is immediately displayed in the image preview area to the left, where the preview can be configured by clicking on the top left icons."

msgid "Next to this box are two icons to select linear or logarithmic histogram display. For images taken with a digital camera the linear mode is usually the most useful. However, for images containing substantial areas of constant color, a linear histogram will often be dominated by a single bar. In this case a logarithmic histogram will be more appropriate."

msgid "Main Curves Editing Area: the horizontal bar (x-axis) represents input values (they are value levels from 0 to 255). The vertical bar (y-axis) is only a scale for output colors of the selected channel. The control curve is drawn on a grid and crosses the histogram diagonally. The pointer x/y position is permanently displayed above the grid. If you click on the curve, a control point is created. You can move it to bend the curve. If you click outside the curve, a control point is also created, and the curve includes it automatically. So each point of the curve represents an 'x' translated into a 'y' output level."

Smooth mode constrains the curve type to a smooth line with tension and provides a realistic rendering. Free mode lets you draw your curve free-hand with the mouse. With curve segments scattered all over the grid, result will be surprising but hardly repeatable. A reset-to-defaults button is also available."

msgid "The curves tool has several features that facilitate the positioning of points on the control curves. Clicking the mouse button in the original image preview area produces a vertical doted bar in the graph area of the curves tool. The bar position corresponds to the pixel value the mouse cursor is over in the image window. Clicking and dragging the mouse button interactively updates the position of the vertical bar. In this way, it is possible to see where different pixel values in the image are located on the control curve and helps to discover the locations of shadow, midtone, and highlight pixels."
