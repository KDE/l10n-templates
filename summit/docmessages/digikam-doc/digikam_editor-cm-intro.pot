msgid "The point of a color-managed workflow is to ensure that the colors coming from your camera or scanner have a predictable relationship with the colors you actually photographed or scanned, that the colors displayed on your monitor match the colors coming from your camera or scanner, and that the colors you print or display on the web match the colors you produced in your digital darkroom."

msgid "When it comes to color management, everyone wants to know, \"which buttons do I push to get the results I want\". Unfortunately, color management of necessity involves making informed choices at every step along the image-processing workflow. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide sufficient background information on color management, along with links to more in-depth information, to enable you to begin to make your own informed decisions, based on your own desired results."
