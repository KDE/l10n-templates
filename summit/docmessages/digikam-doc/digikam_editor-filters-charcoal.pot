msgid "The &digikam; <emphasis>Charcoal</emphasis> filter uses the gradients of color and luminosity to produce a grey scale charcoal sketch. The lines defining the outline of the image are pronounced. Images with slowly changing gradients are not ideal for this effect. It is helpful to imagine what scene you would pick to do as a hand sketch yourself, in order to choose the image to start with."
