msgid "Situated between the more sophisticated Adjust Curves tool and the simpler Brightness/Contrast/Gamma Image Editor tool is this Adjust Levels tool for improving exposure. Although the dialog for this tool looks very complicated, for the basic usage we have in mind here, the only part you need to deal with is the <guilabel>Input Levels</guilabel> area, concretely the 3 sliders that appear below the histogram."

Below the graph are five sliders that can be clicked into and dragged to constrain and change the intensity level for the image. The left sliders position represents the dark areas and similarly, the right position represents the light areas."

msgid "Set <guilabel>Scale</guilabel> for channel : this combo controls whether the histogram will be displayed using a linear or logarithmic amplitude. For images taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is usually the most useful. However, for images that contain substantial areas of constant color a linear histogram will often be dominated by a single bar. In this case a logarithmic histogram will often be more useful."

msgid "<guilabel>Input Levels</guilabel>: the input levels allow manual adjustments to be selected for each of the ranges. The main area is a graphic representation of image dark, mid and light tones content. They are on abscissa from level 0 (black) to level 255 (white). Pixel number for a level is on ordinate axis. The curve surface represents all the pixels of the image for the selected channel (histogram). A well balanced image is an image with levels (tones) distributed all over the whole range. An image with a predominant blue color, for example, will produce a histogram shifted to the left in Green and Red channels, manifested by green and red color lacking on highlights. The level ranges can be modified in three ways:"

msgid "The Adjust Levels tool has several features to facilitate the positioning input levels sliders. Clicking the mouse button in the original image preview area produces a vertical doted bar in the graph area of the histogram. The bar position corresponds to the pixel value under the mouse cursor in the image window. Clicking and dragging the mouse button interactively updates the position of the vertical bar. In this way it is possible to see where different pixel values in the image are located on the input levels sliders and helps to discover the locations of shadow, midtone, and highlight pixels."
