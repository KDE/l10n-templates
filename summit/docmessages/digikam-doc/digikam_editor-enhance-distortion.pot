msgid "<emphasis>Barrel distortion</emphasis> is associated with wide angle (or minimal zoom) lenses. It causes the images to appear slightly spherical (curved outward) like a barrel. You can notice this when you have straight features close to the image's peripheral sides. <emphasis>Pincushion distortion</emphasis> is the opposite defect and is associated with Telephoto lenses (maximum zoom) or underwater images. The images appear pinched (bent inward) toward the center. The Pincushion is often less noticeable than barrel but are equally visible near the edges. These distortions can easily be eliminated without visible loss in quality with this tool."
