msgid "White Balance setting is a common hurdle for digital still cameras. In the 'good old time' of film rolls, the white balance was done by the photolab. Nowadays the poor little camera has to guess what is white and what is black. Most of the time, what the camera chooses as the white point, is not of the correct shade or hue. Using this tool it is easy to correct this problem. It provides a variety of parameters that can be trimmed to obtain a better result."

msgid "The whitebalance correction is somewhat limited by the fact that we operate in 8bit per channel color space. So if you depart too much from the original, over exposure zones may appear. If you can adjust the whitebalance in raw conversion mode (which is done in 16 bit space), the margin for correction will be greater."

msgid "With <guilabel>Exposure</guilabel> you can digitally change the original photo exposure. Increasing the exposure is has the risk of making the pixel noise more visible and to blow out the highlights. Check the <guilabel>Over exposure indicator</guilabel> at the lower right to see if you run into saturation problems. The <guilabel>Black Point</guilabel> adjustment can be used to cut the histogram from the left. If your photograph looks foggy (histogram has empty space on the left, black side), you probably need to use this option. The <guilabel>Exposure</guilabel> and <guilabel>Black Point</guilabel> adjustments can be automatically estimated by pressing the <guilabel>Auto Exposure Adjustments</guilabel> button. This sets the black point quite accurately."

msgid "Increasing the contrast of your photograph can have the side effect of reducing the apparent <guilabel>Saturation</guilabel> of the photo. Use a value larger than 1 to increase the saturation and a value of less than 1 to desaturate the photo. A value of 0 will give you a black and white photo. Don't be shy to bump up the saturation of your photos a little. The general rule is that for higher Contrast (lower <guilabel>Gamma</guilabel>) you need to apply more <guilabel>Saturation</guilabel>."

msgid "The next set of options is the mainstay of White Balance settings, which controls the ratio between the three color channels. Here you can set the color <guilabel>Temperature</guilabel>, making your image warmer or colder. Higher temperature will result in a warmer tint. Setting the ratio between the three color channels requires two adjustments. Since the temperature adjustment mostly controls the ratio between the red and the blue channels, it is natural that the second adjustment will control the intensity of the <guilabel>Green</guilabel> channel."

msgid "<guilabel>Color Temperature</guilabel> is a simplified way to characterize the spectral properties of a light source. While in reality the color of light is determined by how much each point on the spectral curve contributes to its output, the result can still be summarized on a linear scale. This value is useful &eg; for determining the correct white balance in digital photography, and for specifying the right light source types in architectural lighting design. Note, however, that light sources of the same color (metamers) can vary widely in the quality of light emitted."

msgid "Low <guilabel>Color Temperature</guilabel> implies more yellow-red light while high color temperature implies more blue light. Daylight has a rather low color temperature near dawn, and a higher one during the day. Therefore it can be useful to install an electrical lighting system that can supply cooler light to supplement daylight when needed, and fill in with warmer light at night. This also correlates with human feelings towards the warm colors of light coming from candles or an open fireplace at night. Standard unit for color temperature is Kelvin (K)."
