msgid "With the channel combo box you select and display the histogram per color. It gives a first hint of how to correct the channels by their relative distribution and amplitude. The left half of the dialog window always shows a preview of what you are doing. The original for comparison can be seen when selecting its own window tab."

If you check <guilabel>Preserve Luminosity</guilabel> the image will retain its overall luminosity despite you changing its color components. This feature is particularly useful when you also ticked the <guilabel>Monochrome</guilabel> box. Because the channel mixer is THE tool to make great black and white conversions of your photographs. Try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits."

msgid "Sometimes, especially when doing monochrome mixing, reducing one color channel may increase visible noise, which actually originates in the chroma noise. Chroma noise means that the little noise specs do not appear at the same location in all the color channels, but the noise patterns looks different in every channel. If that is the case you can improve the monochrome conversion by reducing the chroma noise first."
