msgid "In this tag tree the keyword <quote>Cat</quote> appears three times. This will not cause a problem within &digikam; but there are quite a few views where the user cannot know which of the three is applied to an image because he might not be able to see the whole hierarchy of the tag. A help could be to tag the image in a case like this also with the parent tag or even the whole hierarchy but it becomes quite unwieldy, &eg; in the image icon if you have the tags displayed there. The second <quote>Cat</quote> can be avoided by calling it <quote>Wild Cat</quote> but calling the third one <quote>Zoo Cat</quote> is a bit out of the roof, I think. And still: there are also two <quote>Cheetah</quote>!"
