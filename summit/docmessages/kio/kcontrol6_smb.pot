msgid "In many small local area networks, the &SMB; protocol is used to offer network services. Names like <quote>&Windows; Network</quote> or <quote>&Windows; for Workgroups Network</quote> or <quote>LanManager</quote> are often used as well. Using &SMB; you can access so-called <quote>shares</quote> (&ie; folders made available by the server) as well as printers."

msgid "&kde; comes with built-in support for the &SMB; protocol. As &kde; is network-transparent that means you can access &SMB; shares from everywhere you can access your local files, for example in the &konqueror; file manager and in the file dialog. To make use of this you should provide &kde; with some information on your &SMB; network. But don't worry, this is normally pretty simple as, for example, all the &Windows; clients in your network need and have the same information."

msgid "Although there are a lot of insecure &SMB; networks out there which allow access to anyone, in principle you have to authenticate yourself to access the services of an &SMB; server. By default, &kde; will use the data entered in the <guilabel>Default user name:</guilabel> and <guilabel>Default password:</guilabel> fields to authenticate itself on &SMB; hosts. If you leave the field <guilabel>Default user name:</guilabel> empty, &kde; will try to access &SMB; hosts without a username. If you leave the default password empty, it will try without a password. If &kde; is unsuccessful accessing the host using these settings, you will be asked for a username and a password."

msgid "While it makes things more comfortable if &kde; stores your &SMB; password, this may be a security problem. If you are using &SMB; in a security conscious environment, you should not store your password here but rather enter it anew every time you need to access an &SMB; host."
