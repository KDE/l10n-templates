msgid "&trojita; is an email program (\"client\") for IMAP accounts. It is a stand-alone program not associated with any Information Suites or equivalent. It prioritizes efficient and fast data transfer, taking care not to re-download any information that has already been downloaded, and being conservative about network usage when you are paying by the minute. Currently under intensive development, it is lacking some features but is evolving fast."

msgid "&trojita; is an email program (\"client\") focused on IMAP email accounts, where the mail remains on the server but is manipulated by the software you run on the computer under your fingertips. It is designed to be simple (it can be built using only one single dependent library), and fast and efficient over the network, economizing resources and limiting data transfer. Its GUI is intended to be uncluttered and efficient, and it provides \"expensive mode\" data transfer, that reduces the length of its conversation with the server to a minimum. It is a stand-alone program, not part of a bigger or more complex suite. As it is under development, some features are still missing."

msgid "&trojita; allows you to read, write, organize, search for, and send email. If you've got an IMAP email account, &trojita; will allow you to access and use it. IMAP is a protocol that allows your mail to stay on the server, rather than downloading it to your local machine. However, &trojita; does in fact download parts of your messages &ndash; even all of your messages &ndash; for convenience. In the 1990s, most people used POP3 mailboxes, and their email software downloaded all their messages, removing them from the server. The disadvantage was that if you used any other computer, your messages were not available. IMAP solves that problem by keeping the mail on the server. The software you use on your local computer/cellphone simply issues instructions (\"reply to this email,\" \"display this email,\" &etc;) for the server to execute."

There are many providers; <ulink url=\"http://fastmail.fm\">FastMail</ulink> is one; <ulink url=\"http://tuffmail.com\">Tuffmail</ulink> and <ulink url=\"http://pobox.com\">Pobox</ulink> are others. Google's Gmail service provides IMAP access to your Gmail account (Outlook and others do not). And if the manager of your &Microsoft; <application>Exchange</application> server has configured it, you can access <application>Exchange</application> through IMAP as well. If you have got an IMAP account, a user name and password, that is all you should need to use &trojita; to access it."
