msgid "<emphasis>Preloading</emphasis> refers to loading an instance of &konqueror; into memory before a user asks to start &konqueror;. The positive effect of this is that when a user asks to load &konqueror; the window appears instantly because most of the application has been preloaded. The negative effect is that this instance of &konqueror; uses memory that could be used by other programs. By default, when a user closes &konqueror;, the instance is not closed. This means that the next time a user wants &konqueror; loaded, it is nearly instantaneous again."

This option will actually decrease performance on some machines (especially those with limited physical memory)."
