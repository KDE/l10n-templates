msgid "&kdesrc-build; has support for &cmake;. A few features of &kdesrc-build; were really features of the underlying buildsystem, including <link linkend=\"conf-configure-flags\">configure-flags</link> and <link linkend=\"conf-do-not-compile\">do-not-compile</link>. When equivalent features are available, they are provided. For instance, the equivalent to the configure-flags option is <link linkend=\"conf-cmake-options\">cmake-options</link>, and the <link linkend=\"conf-do-not-compile\">do-not-compile</link> option is also supported for &cmake; as of &kdesrc-build; version 1.6.3."
