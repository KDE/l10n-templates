msgid "Most cameras don't have GPS receivers, so, most can't save coordinates when taking images. A common approach is to &eg; carry a small GPS logging device along (or nowadays also using a smartphone ;-)), which records a track all the time. Later on, the images' dates can be compared to the GPS log's points' dates to figure out where an image was taken."

msgid "The most convenient approach is automatic matching using geodata provided by GPX files. Those can be loaded and displayed on a map. Using this data, images can be assigned with matching geographic coordinates by finding (more or less) exact chronological matches, or by interpolating a likely position if no exact match can be found."

If the images' dates have a time drift due to the camera's clock being not exactly in sync with the GPS data (which is assumed to be correct), a deviation can be defined. It then will be considered when searching for matches, and can also be used to fix the images' dates."

Elevations can't be ascertained this way, so either, they are left to be \"0 m\" (sea level), entered manually or looked up via opentopodata.org (either automatically or manually, see below)."
