msgid "When translating &kturtle; to a new language you will find, in addition to the &GUI; strings, the programming commands, the examples and the error messages are included in the standard <filename class=\"extension\">.pot</filename> files as used for translation in &kde;. Everything is translated using the regular translation method found in &kde;, yet you are strongly advised to learn a little on how to translate these (as you will also read in the translator comments)."
