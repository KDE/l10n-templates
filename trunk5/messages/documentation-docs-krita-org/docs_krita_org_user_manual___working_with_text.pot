#: ../../user_manual/working_with_text.rst:23
msgid "The main tool for text is the :ref:`text_tool`, which allows you to create text objects. It also allows you to edit ranges of text, that is, typing, copying and pasting text. But also setting the font, color and size on a range, and even more advanced type setting, like selecting glyph alternates and precise positioning of glyphs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/working_with_text.rst:25

#: ../../user_manual/working_with_text.rst:27
msgid "However, the Text Tool can only edit a single text at a time. To edit multiple texts, you can use the :ref:`shape_selection_tool`. The Text Properties Docker will edit all selected text objects when using the Shape Selection Tool. Additionally, the Shape Selection Tool can be used to set text on path, or put text into multiple shapes."

msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/working_with_text.rst:126
msgid "Now, when creating a comic, it is important that the text is consistent and and easy to read. To ensure that, you can use :ref:`resource_style_presets`. First, create a text. Then, with the :ref:`text_properties_docker`, set the preferred font, and the font size. Finally, create a style preset by going to the :guilabel:`Preset` tab, and there selecting :guilabel:`New Preset`. A dialog will pop up, where you can set the name and the style sample."

msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/working_with_text.rst:135
msgid "It can be tricky to determine a readable font size, as images on screen are bigger or smaller than their printed outputs depending on the screen. This is because programs like Krita display images so that at 100% a single pixel in the image is a single pixel on the screen. But it is possible to switch to physical size too. There's a button next to the zoom slider at the bottom that allows you to switch between pixel sizing and physical sizing. When switched to physical sizing, Krita will display the image zoomed to its physical size at 100%."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/working_with_text.rst:137
msgid "To determine a readable font size, you then create a text with your preferred font. Then switch to physical size. If you work at twice the physical size, you will need to zoom to 50%, if not, zoom to 100%. Then, sit at an arms' length from the monitor, and adjust the font size of the text until it is pleasant to read."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/working_with_text.rst:139
msgid "If you don't work for print, you can skip the physical zoom step, and instead adjust the zoom so that it is the same size on screen as the end result. Then adjust the font size as necessary."

msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/working_with_text.rst:146
msgid "Now, you might be working off a script or a very rough sketch. The first thing you do then is create new texts. You can do this with the :ref:`text_tool`, by |mouseleft| + dragging a large rectangle to create a :ref:`text_inline_wrapped` area. Then type your text. This inline-wrapped length is useful here because it doesn't cut off at any given point, so you can focus on typing text and adjusting it afterwards."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/working_with_text.rst:148
msgid "You can use the :ref:`shape_selection_tool` to select multiple text shapes and adjust them with the :ref:`text_properties_docker`. This will only affect the :guilabel:`Paragraph` level properties."
