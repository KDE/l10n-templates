msgid "Live Stacker makes use of KStars internal Plate Solving so it is crucial that this is setup to work correctly. Plate Solving in KStars is flexible and functions like Align and Guide have their own Plate Solving SEP profiles. Live Stacker uses the FITSViewer Plate Solving functionality and default profile, so this is the profile to check if you have issues. Go to the Plate Solve tab in FITSViewer and see which default SEP profile you are using. Choose a different one if that works for you. Make sure you can reliably plate solve subframes with your chosen SEP profile. See the Fits Viewer Solver section of this manual for more information."
