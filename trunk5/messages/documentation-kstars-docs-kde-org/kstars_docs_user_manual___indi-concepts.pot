msgid "The main key concept in INDI is that devices have the ability to describe themselves. This is accomplished by using XML to describe a generic hierarchy that can represent both canonical and non-canonical devices. In INDI, all *devices* may contain one or more *properties*. Any *property* may contain one or more *elements*. There are four types of INDI properties:"

msgid "Permission: All properties can either be read-only, write-only, or read and write enabled. An example of a read-write property is the telescope's Right Ascension. You can enter a new Right Ascension and the telescope, based on current settings, will either slew or sync to the new input. Furthermore, when the telescope slews, its Right Ascension gets updated and sent back to the client."
