#: ../../shapes.rst:54
msgid "Top level layers can have other top-level layers set as their parents, inheriting their parent's transformations, this allows some more advanced layouts for example you could have two layers with the same parent layer and a third unrelated layer between them. This is not possible with plain group shapes."

msgstr ""

#: ../../shapes.rst:169
