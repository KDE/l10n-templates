"**Kate:** `U` and `Ctrl+r` is redo<br> **Vim:** `Ctrl+r` is normal redo, `U`"
" is used to undo all latest changes on one line<br> The reason for having "
"`U` act as redo in Kate's VI mode is that the shortcut `ctrl+r` by default "
"is taken by Kate's replace function (search and replace). By default, the VI"
" mode won't override Kate's shortcuts (this can be configured in Settings → "
"Configure Kate… → Editing → Vi Input Mode), therefore a redo-action needs to"
" be available as a “regular” key press, too. Besides, the behaviour of the U"
" command in Vim doesn't map well to Kate's internal undo system, so it would"
" be non-trivial to support anyway."

"are available not only in the VI mode but for users using “regular” Kate, "
"too – I have therefore chosen to let the `:print` command open the print "

"Vim's behaviour."
