"Logging is a &kdesrc-build; feature whereby the output from every command "
"that &kdesrc-build; runs is saved to a file for examination later, if "
"necessary. This is done because it is often necessary to have the output of "
"these programs when there is a build failure, because there are so many "
"reasons why a build can fail in the first place."

"The logs are always stored under the log directory. The destination of the "
"log directory is controlled by the <link linkend=\"conf-log-dir\">log-dir</"

"${source-dir}</symbol>/log</filename> (where <symbol>${source-dir}</symbol> "

"time that &kdesrc-build; was run. Each directory is named with the date, and "
"the run number. For instance, the second time that &kdesrc-build; is run on "
"May 26, 2004, it would create a directory called <filename>2004-05-26-02</"
"filename>, where the 2004-05-26 is for the date, and the -02 is the run "

"If a module itself has a submodule (such as extragear/multimedia, playground/"

"&kdesrc-build; run would be found in <filename class=\"directory\"><symbol>"
"${log-dir}</symbol>/latest/KDE/kdelibs</filename>, and not under <filename "

"(for a module checkout or when updating a module that has already been "
"checked out). If the <command>configure</command> command was run, then you "
