"The actual source checkout can take up a fair amount of space. The default "
"modules take up about 1.6 gigabytes of on-disk space. You can reduce this "
"amount by making sure that you are only building as many modules as you "
"actually want. &kdesrc-build; will not delete source code from disk even if "
"you delete the entry from the <link linkend=\"configure-data\">configuration "
"file</link>, so make sure that you go and delete unused source checkouts "
"from the source directory. Note that the source files are downloaded from "
"the Internet, you <emphasis>should not</emphasis> delete them if you are "
"actually using them, at least until you are done using &kdesrc-build;."

"Also, if you already have a &Qt; installed by your distribution (and the "

"module. That will shave about 200 megabytes off of the on-disk source size."

"&kdesrc-build; will create a separate build directory to build the source "
"code in. Sometimes &kdesrc-build; will have to copy a source directory to "
"create a fake build directory. When this happens, space-saving symlinks are "
"used, so this should not be a hassle on disk space. The build directory will "
"typically be much larger than the source directory for a module. For "
"example, the build directory for kdebase is about 1050 megabytes, whereas "
"kdebase's source is only around 550 megabytes."

"Luckily, the build directory is not required after a module has successfully "

"directory after installing a module, see the examples below for more "

"You should be very sure you know what you are doing before deciding to "
"remove debugging information. Running bleeding-edge software means you are "
"running software which is potentially much more likely to crash than a "
"stable release. If you are running software without debugging information, "
"it can be very hard to create a good bug report to get your bug resolved, "
"and you will likely have to re-enable debugging information for the affected "
"application and rebuild to help a developer fix the crash. So, remove "
"debugging information at your own risk!"
