"Debugging support is provided for Assembly, SDCC and Microbe, when they are "
"open as a text document. From here, stepping is controlled via the "
"<guimenu>Debug</guimenu> menu. There are two methods of starting the "
"debugger."

"If the PIC program is already running in a circuit, then double-clicking on "
"the PIC component will open up the program. For assembly PIC programs, the "
"debugger for that text document will be linked into the PIC component. In "
"this case, the debug menu cannot stop the PIC program - as this is owned by "
"the PIC component."

"If the assembly file is already opened, then the debugger can be run via the "
"<guimenu>Debug</guimenu> menu. After compiling the program, the debugger "
"will be ready, with the PIC program paused at the first instruction. Note "
"that when debugging high level languages, the current execution point will "
"not be shown if there is no line that corresponds to the first assembly "
"instruction to be executed. In this case, clicking <guibutton>Next</"
"guibutton> will bring the execution point to the first line in the program."

"The debugger can be in one of two modes: running, and stepping. While "
"running, the PIC program will be simulated in realtime. To allow stepping, "
"the PIC program must be paused - either by clicking on "
"<guimenuitem>Interrupt</guimenuitem> in the <guimenu>Debug</guimenu> menu, "
"or clicking on the pause button on the PIC component."

"In stepping mode, a green arrow in the margin of the text document indicates "
"the next line to be executed (familiar to <application>KDevelop</"
"application> users). It may be useful to turn on the icon border via the "
"<guimenu>View</guimenu> menu (it can be permanently turned on via the "
"<guilabel>Editor Settings</guilabel> dialog)."

"<guimenuitem>Step Over</guimenuitem> - If the next instruction to be "
"executed is a call, or similar, then this will \"step over\" the call, "
"returning to stepping mode once the call has returned. Otherwise, stepping "
"over an instruction behaves identically to step. To put it technically - the "
"initial stack level is recorded, and the program execution is paused once "
"the stack level returns to its initial level."

"<guimenuitem>Step Out</guimenuitem> - If the current execution is inside a "
"call, or similar, then this will wait until the call returns. Similarly to "
"stepping over, this is equivalent to waiting until the stack level returns "
"to one less than the initial level, if the initial level is greater than "
"zero."

"Breakpoints allow the execution to be paused when the PIC program reaches a "

"The <guilabel>Symbol Viewer</guilabel> sidebar on the right shows the values "
"of the Special Function Registers. To find out the value of a variable in "
"the General Purpose Registers, you can hover your mouse over the variable "
"name in an instruction that operates on that register. Note that the radix "
"selection in the <guilabel>Symbol Viewer</guilabel> also controls how the "
