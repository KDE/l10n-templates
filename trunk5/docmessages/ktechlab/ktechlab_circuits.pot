"All components have a notion of orientation; 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees. "
"Those that aren't symmetrical about an axis can also be flipped. To rotate a "
"selection of components, either right click and select from the "
"<guimenu>Orientation</guimenu> menu, or click on the rotate buttons in the "
"toolbar. The latter can also be accessed by pressing the <keycap>[</keycap> "
"and <keycap>]</keycap> keys (familiar to <application>Inkscape</application> "
"users). The <guilabel>Item</guilabel> sidebar (on the right) provides a "
"powerful method of setting the orientation by providing previews of the "
"components. Flipping components is also only possibly via the "
"<guilabel>Item</guilabel> sidebar."

"The best way to get a feel for manual connection routing is by experimenting "

"When a circuit is created or modified, the affected areas are partitioned up "
"into groups of pins and connections that can be considered independent. Each "
"group is then simulated as a separate entity (although still interacting via "
"the components), with the simulation provided dependent on the group's "
"complexity. Complex groups, such as those involving nonlinear components "
"like LEDs, are slow to simulate. Groups that contain only logic pins, of "
"which only one controls the value on those pins, are the fastest to simulate."
