"In very general terms, an <emphasis>investment</emphasis> is any allocation "
"of money with the expectation of a future benefit. &kmymoney;'s Investment "
"accounts are designed for one particular type of investment: securities. A "
"security investment (or just a security) is an instrument for investing "
"money that is traded on a market with the intention of a profitable return "
"in the form of either appreciation in value, income such as interest or "
"dividends, or a combination of both. Stocks and mutual funds are the most "
"common securities; and they are the ones specifically supported within "
"&kmymoney;. Bonds have a different financial structure, but can usually be "
"handled by &kmymoney;. Futures, commodities, options, and more complex "
"investment instruments like derivatives are other types of investments, but "
"&kmymoney; has no special functionality for them. As long an investment has "
"similar characteristics to a stock or mutual fund, it can be tracked."
