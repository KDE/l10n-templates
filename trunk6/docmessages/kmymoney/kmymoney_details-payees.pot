"Payees represent people or organizations to whom you give money. Payers are "
"those from whom you receive money. They are handled identically in "
"&kmymoney; and are only distinguished by the direction in which the money "
"moves. It is possible for a single person or organization to be both a Payee "
"and a Payer. An example is your employer, who pays you money as a salary, "
"but whom you might pay money when you eat lunch in the cafeteria at work. It "
"is completely your choice whether to use the same Payee for both of these "
"transaction types, or to create a separate Payee and Payer, if you want to "
"track them separately."
