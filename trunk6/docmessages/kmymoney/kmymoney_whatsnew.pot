"As with every release, the &kmymoney; development team continues to work "
"hard to make each version better and easier to use in every way. Many bugs "
"have been fixed since the previous stable release of 5.1.3; several areas of "
"the program have seen functional enhancements; but the major noticeable "
"changes from the 5.1 series of releases are in the ledger - more details "
"below."

"The conversion from using the earlier &kde; libraries to &kde-frameworks; "
"was essentially complete in the early 5.1.x releases, with much of that work "
"behind the scenes and not directly visible to the end user. The general look "
"and feel should continue to remain stable, although some minor changes may "
"be noticeable. In addition, the team has begun to make changes to support "
"the conversion to using Qt6 and KDE6 libraries, which have already started "
"to replace Qt5 and KDE5. With all these changes, the basic functionality of "
"the program remains the same, aside from intentional bug fixes, "
"improvements, and additions."

"In past releases, this section of the manual included a list of many of the "
"specific bug fixes and functional enhancements. However, rather than "
"duplicating that information, you can find it directly in the <ulink url="

"The 5.0.x and 5.1.x series included some changes needing adjustments on the "
"user's side, if they were upgrading from 4.8.x or an older version. However, "
"we expect that most users have converted to 5.1.x by now. Specifically, "
"there should be no adjustments needed by users converting from 5.1.x to 5.2. "
"If for some reason, you are still using &kmymoney; version 4, you are very "
"strongly encouraged to upgrade, as it is getting increasingly difficult for "
"the team to provide any assistance for very old versions."
