"If the application is &kde; software, first use the search function in "

"searching the <ulink url=\"https://docs.kde.org/\">&kde; Documentation site</"
"ulink> for the requested documentation. If you find the documentation on "
"that site, your distribution might ship a separate package for documentation "
"(&eg; called plasma-doc for documentation related to &plasma;). Please use "
"the package manager of your distribution to find and install the missing "
