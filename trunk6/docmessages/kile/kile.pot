"&latex; is a text-processing system derived from &tex;, a program developed "
"originally in 1977 by Donald Knuth to help layout text in a professional way "
"and obtain a layout quality that is on a par with the work of a professional "
"typesetter. &latex; was created by Leslie Lamport to give authors an "
"automatic typesetter, especially to ease the expensive and painstaking "
"process of typesetting of mathematical formulas and expressions, which are "
"enclosed within dollar signs in &latex; <emphasis>for a reason</emphasis>. "
"Today, word-processing programs let any user act as typesetter, but what is "
"often needed is a document that simply looks good without having to spend "
"hours to bring it into shape. &latex; takes that burden on its shoulders, "
"and lets you concentrate on the document instead of on the layout. And yes, "

"There is a funny tradition of &tex;-related packages to have the strangest "

"&latex; itself only understands ASCII, which represents a very limited set "
"of characters. Hence, it is not possible to use accented characters "
"directly. To use them nevertheless, a special syntax was invented: such as "
"for example <userinput>\\\"e</userinput> for <computeroutput>ë</"
"computeroutput>. The <application>inputenc</application> package is "
"available to help you with this. It is included in the preamble using "
"<userinput>\\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}</userinput>, where the optional "
"argument specifies the encoding you would like to use (nowadays in most "
"cases <userinput>utf8</userinput>). This tells &latex; to translate all of "
"the <userinput>ë</userinput>'s you wrote to <userinput>\\\"e</userinput>'s "
"before compiling. Please refer to the <application>inputenc</application> "
