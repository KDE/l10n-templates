"Most digital cameras embed a thumbnail on RAW format files and quite often "
"this thumbnail is actually of sufficient size, might be even full sized. "
"Selecting to use this embedded thumbnail will fasten up all image operations "
"as decoding raw files is very time consuming but the thumbnail is many times "
"faster. You can also specify the minimum size for the thumbnail so that the "
"RAW image is decoded if the thumbnail is of useless size."
