"If you are like me you have thousands of images ever since you got your "
"first camera, some taken with a normal camera other with a digital camera. "
"Through all the years you believed that until eternity you would be able to "
"remember the story behind every single picture, you would be able to "
"remember the names of all the people on your images, and you would be able "
"to remember the exact date of every single image. I personally realized that "
"this was not possible anymore, and especially for my digital images - but "
"also for my paper images - I needed a tool to help me describe my images, "
"and to search in the pile of images. This is exactly what &kphotoalbum; is "
"all about."

"It must be easy to annotate a number of images at a time. It must for "
"example not take more than a few mouse clicks to mark all your images from "
"your holiday as being from Italy, 1992. &kphotoalbum; offers two ways of "
"describing images: <guilabel>one at a time</guilabel>, which is useful for "
"writing text about images, and <guilabel>All Simultaneously</guilabel>, "
"which is useful for selecting a number of images, and setting properties "
"like location, people on images, and date of image."

"It must be easy to search for images. &kphotoalbum; offers to describe "
"images with a number of properties. These includes date, people, places, "
"plus a keyword field the user can use for custom keywords like "
"<emphasis>Album 7</emphasis> or <emphasis>Holiday trip to Italy</emphasis>. "
"With &kphotoalbum; you can search for images in each of the categories - e."
"g. find all the images with Jesper on them from the holiday in Italy. It is "
"of course possible to create your own categories, much more on that later."

"It must be easy to browse and View the images. When viewing images, your "
"focus often changes - one moment you are looking at images from your holiday "
"in 1992, and when seeing an image of a friend whom you spent that holiday "
"with, you focus suddenly changes, so you want to see all images of that "
"friend."

"&kphotoalbum; started out as an application for managing your images, but "
"since then it has been extended, so it today also takes care of your videos. "
"In many places in this manual I will talk about images, but just as often "

"&kphotoalbum; uses all the images of a directory and all subdirectories "
"below it, first time you start &kphotoalbum;, you will be asked for the "
"location of this directory. &kphotoalbum; will not modify any images, so you "

"&kphotoalbum; to delete individual images, from <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</"

"&kphotoalbum; will save all its information in the file <filename>index.xml</"
"filename> in your topmost image directory. This file is a simple XML file, "
"so you can easily back it up using whatever tools you prefer, including "
"normal backup utilities, copying the file to a floppy disk, or keeping "
"revisions using VCS. There is also a backup script (<emphasis>kpa-backup.sh</"
"emphasis>) provided in &kphotoalbum;'s sources that backs up not only the "
"index.xml but also the configuration files inside user's home directory."
