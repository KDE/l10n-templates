"The key feature of &kphotoalbum; is that you can annotate your images. This "

"either one image at a time, or you can annotate a number of images "
"simultaneously (For example, all these images contain the person "
"<emphasis>Jesper</emphasis>, and is taken in <emphasis>Copenhagen</"

"the other. If you instead choose <guimenuitem>Annotate Multiple Items at a "
"Time</guimenuitem>, you will annotate all the selected items as if it was "
"one single item. In other words, with this option you mass-annotate your "
"image - e.g. saying all these images were shot in Copenhagen. These two "
"options are also available from a context menu, that you get by right "
"clicking the mouse in the thumbnail overview or using keyboard shortcut. An "
