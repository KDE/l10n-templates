"&ktechlab; is an IDE for electronic circuits and microcontrollers. It can "
"perform simulation a variety of components (logic, integrated, linear, "
"nonlinear and reactive), simulation and debugging of PIC microcontrollers "
"via gpsim, and comes with its own closely-linked and complementary high "
"level languages: &flowcode; and &microbe;."

"It has been designed to be as easy to use and unintrusive as possible; all "
"components and FlowParts have context sensitive help, and simulating "
"electronics is as simple as dragging components onto the work area and "
"creating connectors that autoroute themselves between their pins. &flowcode; "
"allows users new to PICs to instantly create their own programs, while the "
"electronic simulation allows stepping through a PIC's assembly program "
"inside a circuit."

"&ktechlab; uses a Document-View model, in that the Document logic is "
"completely separate from open views of the document. This allows several "
"views of the same file."

"On creating a new document, the view is created in a separate tab. Each tab "
"can support any number of views, tiled in any arbitrary pattern. This "
"allows, for example, simulating a PIC program in circuit, while stepping "
"through the program in an assembly document in the same tab."

"When a drawing is selected, it can be resized by dragging its handles. "
