"Generic term for different variants of the traditional &UNIX; printing "
"method. Its first version appeared in the early 70s on BSD &UNIX; and was "
"formally described in &linkstart;\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1179.txt"
"\"&linkmid;RFC 1179&linkend; only as late as 1990.&newpara; At the time when "
"BSD \"remote\" printing was first designed, printers were serially or "
"otherwise directly connected devices to a host (with the Internet hardly "
"consisting of more than 100 nodes!); printers used hole-punched, continuous "
"paper, fed through by a tractor mechanism, with simple rows of ASCII text "
"mechanically hammered on to the medium, drawn from a cardboard box beneath "
"the table. It came out like a zig-zag folded paper \"snake\". Remote "
"printing consisted of a neighboring host in the next room sending a file "
"asking for printout.&newpara; How technology has changed! Printers generally "
"use cut-sheet media, they have built-in intelligence to compute the raster "
"images of pages after pages that are sent to them using one of the powerful "
"page description languages (PDL). Many are network nodes in their own right, "
"with CPU, RAM, a hard disk and their own Operation System, and are hooked to "
"a net with potentially millions of users...&newpara; It is a vast proof of "
"the flexible &UNIX; concept for doing things, that it made \"Line Printing\" "
"reliably work even under these modern conditions. But time has finally come "
"now to go for something new -- the IPP."

"Already years ago, when Linux printing was still really difficult (only "
"command line printing was known to most Linux users, no device specific "
"print options were available for doing the jobs), Grant Taylor, author of "
"the \"Linux Printing HOWTO\", collected most of the available information "
"about printers, drivers and filters in his database.&newpara; With the "
"emerging &CUPS; concept, extending the use of PPDs even to non-PostScript "
"printers, he realized the potential of this database: if one puts the "
"different datablobs (with content that could be described along the lines "
"\"Which device prints with which Ghostscript or other filter?\", \"How well?"
"\", and \"What command line switches are available?\") into PPD-compatible "
"files, he could have all the power of &CUPS; on top of the traditional "
"printer \"drivers\".&newpara; This has now developed into a broader concept, "
"known as \"Foomatic\". Foomatic extends the capabilities of spoolers other "
"than &CUPS; (LPR/LPD, LPRng, PDQ, PPR) to a certain degree (\"stealing\" "
"some concepts from &CUPS;). The Linuxprinting Database is not a Linux-only "
"stop -- people running other &UNIX; based OSes (like *BSD or &macOS;) will "
"also find valuable information and software there."
