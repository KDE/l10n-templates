"Remote Frame Buffer (or <acronym>RFB</acronym> for short) is a simple "
"protocol for remote access to graphical user interfaces. It works at the "
"frame-buffer level, which roughly corresponds to the rendered screen image, "
"which means that it can be applied to all windowing systems (including X11, "
"&MacOS; and &Microsoft; &Windows;). Remote Frame Buffer applications exist "
"for many platforms, and can often be freely re-distributed."

"In the Remote Frame Buffer protocol, the application that runs on the "
"machine where the user sits (containing the display, keyboard and pointer) "
"is called the client. The application that runs on the machine where the "
"framebuffer is located (which is running the windowing system and "
"applications that the user is remotely controlling) is called the server. "
"&krfb; is the &kde; server for the Remote Frame Buffer protocol. &krdc; is "

"It takes a reasonable amount of network traffic to send an image of the "
"framebuffer, so Remote Frame Buffer works best over high bandwidth links, "
"such as a local area network. It is still possible to use &krfb; over other "
"links, but performance is unlikely to be as good."
